The Washington Establishment will never rein in government spending, waste, fraud and abuse. A great thinker and outsider is needed. When will the US government finally classify China as a currency manipulator? China is robbing us blind and @BarackObama defends them. I play golf to relax.

Herman Cain handled the pressure of the debate really well.  @THEHermancain Rick Perry is a good guy who had a really tough evening.  @RickPerry Mitt Romney did great in the debate last night. The Fannie and Freddie execs should not get million dollar bonuses with our tax dollars. They were bailed out with $169B of our money. China is advocating on behalf of Iran's nuclear program -- the Chinese oppose both sanctions and any militar (cont) http://t.co/QX8AASwG He is out of real solutions--@BarackObama's job bill is nothing more than a tax increase. The @SuperCommittee will fail. The Republicans never should have agreed to the debt deal. Instead of trash talking @PMIsrael on the world stage, @BarackObama should be defending @Israel. America should not be pressuring @Israel to show restraint against Iran. We should be working to stop Iran's nuclear drive. Some @OWS protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system--others just in for the party. Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing. Washington does not have a revenue problem. The Federal government spent over $3.7 trillion last year. This is unsustainable and a true danger. The American dream is being destroyed. #timetogettough The White House Correspondents' Dinner in my new book "Time To Get Tough".....watch the #trumpvlog--- http://t.co/uRim6jQw A record high 6.7% of Americans are living in extreme poverty. This is tragic.  We can do better. Reporter @AlHunt is one boring and low vision guy!

We can't allow Iran to go nuclear. Malfeasance at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped cause our current financial meltdown. My interview on @gretawire discussing the economy and @TheHermanCain "Witch Hunt" http://t.co/C0YnLOKl Watch my interview with Greta Van Susteren @gretawire tonight on Fox News at 10 p.m. The Oil Companies collude with OPEC to keep oil artificially overvalued. They need to be reigned in. The greatest threat to our security is our debt. It is already past 100% GDP. We need to make real budget cuts. The economy won't fully recover until  @ObamaCare is fully repealed. It is a job killer! Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood just made its first visit to Hamas-led Gaza. Why did @BarackObama promote the "Arab Spring"? Why is @BarackObama letting the Taliban know when our troops are leaving? http://t.co/V1CrdfCb  This is dangerous for our soldiers. The  @SuperCommittee must cut spending, not raise taxes. Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. Another company that the DOE has given money to just filed for bankruptcy. This is how the money we borrow at 40% from China is wasted. Is Jon Stewart a racist? See video that includes clip... http://t.co/tUae4cWq #thedailyshow The Republicans never should have agreed to this past summer's debt deal.  Military cuts will now come along with tax increases. THe Chinese military is already hacking our satellites http://t.co/SeQio55u.   The Chinese government is not an American ally. It snowed over 4 inches this past weekend in New York City. It is still October. So much for Global Warming. The Al Qaeda flag is now flying over Benghazi. @BarackObama spent over $3Billion of our money for this? Is Jon Stewart a racist? See video--- http://t.co/ZbjW0Tny @thedailyshow Bernie Madoff and Tony La Russa in today's #trumpvlog...  http://t.co/FKLa4YPo Our economy cannot stay competitive with policies like these: @BarackObama is proposing over $90 Billion in new regulations. ObamaCare contains marriage penalty taxes. Why should married couples be penalized for having healthcare? My interview from last night with @piersmorgan discussing OWS  http://t.co/FbHSUdnt My interview yesterday with @TeamCavuto discussing Europe's debt deal and the GOP primary   http://t.co/1Tz0Hevr The US Air Force won the war in Libya to clear the way for Islamic Extremist control of Libya. Our worst threat to unemployment is @ObamaCare.  It will also destroy our country's basic standards. When will our nation's sacrifices  be respectfully appreciated? Iraq and Libya should reimburse us in oil. The Debt is our nation's greatest threat. @BarackObama is out of touch. Watch me tonight at 9PM ET on @CNN, full hour. @Piersmorgan won @ApprenticeNBC before taking over Larry King's slot- should be interesting. Why aren't we getting any oil from Iraq before we leave? We are leaving the country wide open for Iran. Big mistake. When will Washington stand up to China. China is manipulating its currency and stealing our jobs. Washington should move on legislation. I am happy to see the majority of the GOP candidates agree with me that the tax code must be simplified and the rates dropped.

So much for creating American jobs--@BarackObama gave $529 Million to a "Green" car company---so they can be manufactured in Finland. The job plan by @BarackObama is nothing more than a second stimulus. The first failed and so will this one. See what I have to say about Iran and Iraq in today's #trumpvlog... http://t.co/T44XcgeY We are leaving Iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure. We should be reimbursed with oil! -- Don't give it to Iran. The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen. The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation. Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets? China is an enemy, not a friend. The Misery Index is at a 28 year high. Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors? Iran is a threat to our national security. A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector. Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil? What do we get out of this? Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?  OPEC is  ripping us off. Not worth $30/Barrel.  America needs new leaders.

Stop "The China Curse" -- Pass the Chinese Currency Bill! My @FoxNews interview on @gretawire discussing "The China Curse" http://t.co/F2ezH1Jb Tweet me your questions to answer. #trumpvlog Tune in tonight to Greta van Susteren's  show, On the Record, which airs on Fox News at 9 p.m. Mitt Romney is right about the Chinese rip-off of America. The debate was very interesting last night. There were numerous winners and Governor Romney did very well. When will @BarackObama release an actual budget? I don't want to be the only billionaire in America---I want all Americans to be rich. If the Prez wants to create jobs talk to some business people---not liberal intellectuals. The only way to spread economic growth is to lower taxes and end unfriendly regulatory practices. The Fed's reckless monetary policy is going to create record inflation. New study shows 80% of Congress have no business experience--it shows! A guy named @BobBeckel on FOX, their resident liberal, was not born with much of a brain. I have traveled the world. America is the most beautiful country on Earth. The only job @BarackObama cares about is his own. Everything he does is for his own reelection. When will we stop wasting our money on rebuilding Afghanistan? We must rebuild our country first. The GOP primary schedule is a disaster. Not enough time.

What a disgrace. In order to save Medicare and stop record premium increases--we must repeal ObamaCare. Washington is wasting over $2 billion this year on Solyndra type loans. Yet they want to cut military spending. China is threatening Washington over the currency bill.  We should pass it immediately. Our national debt has grown by 30% and a gallon of gas has doubled so far under @BarackObama. He is a disaster. The Democrats in the Super Committee want to raise taxes first in deficit talks. Huge mistake. Cut wasteful spending first. Great meeting with @THEHermanCain yesterday in Trump Tower. Great guy!

The only way for Medicare and Social Security to remain solvent is if our economy is healthy. @BarackObama doesn't get it. The Iranians have just threatened to send warships to our coasts. They laugh at us. We can't allow them to develop nuclear weapons. The Fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation. China does not negotiate from a position of strength, we simply negotiate against ourselves. We have all the advantages but don't execute.

I will be at Macys Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal! Want jobs? Slash corporate tax rate.  Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US.  America will boom. I watched POTUS speech from Europe---same old "tax and spend" won't create jobs. Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program? The US should look at future funding. China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion. @BarackObama is their favorite client.

If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas? Crude is at $85 right now  isnt even worth half that. OPEC is ripping us off.

Economic growth can save Social Security, Medicare and America. Mike Huckebee, a great guy, said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary. China and OPEC would not be happy. Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity. He believes in Government.

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America. Watched Sean Hannity last night -- a great guy. If Obama has to re-fight this fight next year he loses  -- "Watch the fine details in every deal" -- The Art of the Deal Blue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts? Bad idea. "Never quit and always hit back" -- The Art of the Comeback I just got Mike Leach's new book,  Swing Your Sword. He's a great coach, and he's written a great book. It's definitely worth reading. I appreciate the kind words of Mike Huckabee, a fine American http://bit.ly/pEBsgY My wife Melania Trump's show was a tremendous success last night. In case you missed her, you can see her again tonight on @QVC at 7 pm ET Please tweet me your questions to answer in my #trumpvlog. My interview yesterday from Newsmax - "Obama Is  'Now Totally Lost,'  Boehner Must Not Fold"  http://bit.ly/n7Ahdk People ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time--they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous! "Know when to walk away from the table."   The Art of the Deal Watch my wife Melania Trump tonight on @QVC at 1 a.m.  So proud of her! Higher Taxes kill job creation---cut wild government spending and waste. China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves---US needs our toughest negotiator---and fast! America's debt is greater than our GDP. Time for new thinking. My interview from yesterday on Fox and Friends -- "GOP Crazy If  They Don't Get Everything They  Want"  http://bit.ly/nKsBBF My thoughts on the situation in Norway and Amanda Knox... http://t.co/225OYhf #trumpvlog Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions---cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors. Obama, sadly, has no business or private sector background---and it shows. The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @BarackObama.... http://t.co/9gFfiFM #trumpvlog The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly. We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline. Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things Ronald Kessler's new book "The Secrets of the FBI" is a great book that should be read by everyone. "Increasing Americas debt weakens us domestically and internationally." - US Senator @BarackObama, 2007 My interview on @gretawire last night  - "Our Leaders Are Leading Us Into 'Oblivion'" http://t.co/ZOGcrx3 "The Gang of Six" - yet another unmitigated disaster. ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE. T-E-A. "China is our enemy--they want to destroy us" -- Redstate Interview Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency. His record proves it. Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly. While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs. Such a total failure---as a President. So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit...How low have we as a nation sunk? The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity. Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal. Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1.40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs. CUT-CAP-BALANCE! #trumpvlog The Republicans must act now, don't let @barackobama push you around.... http://t.co/PHlzxON Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of  their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday.

Both Wrong! ObamaCare Tragedy Primed to Further Explode the Deficit  http://t.co/wRxqlxA  And @Obama transferred $500 billion from Medicare to fund it! If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency. THe Art of the Deal--"The best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you have." CUT, CAP and BALANCE. Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUT,CAP and BALANCE. Congress is back.TIME TO CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.There is no revenue problem.The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained. Perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in Washington ... http://t.co/IsqXBu1 Tomorrow we'll be going to Panama for the opening of our new hotel.

Price gouging at many gas stations, $10 a gallon--welcome to the new world. Its hard to believe that we are rationing gas in NYC. OPEC is laughing all the way to the bank.  @cyndilauper Condolences on the passing of your uncle, and best wishes.  @antbaxter Only the stupid @BBC would air your garbageno wonder they are in such deep trouble.  @antbaxter  Anthonydid you illegally take clips from the Letterman @Late_Show show and @GolfChannel without their approval?  @antbaxter  I predict somebody is going to sue you!  @antbaxter Dummy,thanks for increasing awareness of my big golf project in Aberdeensales are thru the roof & Aberdeen seeing big benefits.  @antbaxterHeard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to makewhere did you get that kind of money?  @antbaxterYour documentary works better than any sleeping pillin fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage! Why do so many people say I hate President ObamaI dont hate the President at all. I just disagree with his policies! 9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last & yet the Republicans lostdo you think they might be doing something wrong! I got to know @johnboehner very wellhe is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country! I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy. It was my pleasure to help. Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight. He took my advice on Kristen Stewart...I hope! The election was a major setback for economy. All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments. Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina. I'm proud of @NCGOP & glad I delivered keynote at their state convention. Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous? Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio & he would be President. Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History China is heavily investing in building its own jet engine http://t.co/QTYCvpUc  They will end up stealing the design from us as usual. China's submarines will soon be carrying nukes http://t.co/oX6JYnqE  They will be sent to patrol our coasts, Obama won't do anything. China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.  They have never had it so good.  Will own America soon. At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes. This was a winnable race.  GOP needs to do better! With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.  Can get a great deal.  @davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure. @IvankaTrump says hi. No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.  They love a weak America that they can rip off. Obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again http://t.co/v7RwPT0P Thanks for letting us know now I will and I agree! RT @ZacharyQuinto
@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money. so why don't you make a difference instead?! I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign. Everything A-Rod touches turns bad. Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.  They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now. It is that time of the year.  The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park.  The greatest ice rink in the country. Letterman @Late_Show had Brian Williams @NBCNightlyNews as guest last night, I was on last Thursday ...I  trounced him in ratings & Letterman beat @jayleno last Thursday. Brianare you irrelevant? Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his  comments on Sandy & the death & destruction it caused. A test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @ABC (other than his bad ratings).  @hardball_chris says hes glad we had a hurricane! With many people dying and thousands hurting, MSNBC (cont) http://t.co/SnhGmaoQ A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and the real reason. -- J. P. Morgan Now that the election is over, watch Chrysler ship @Jeep production to China--my prediction. It has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle.  We will fight on! Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.  The Chinese are happier with the election than we are. The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.  Welcome to @BarackObamas second term. Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle. Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in, the Republicans lost. What a waste of money. Millions without electricity across NY & NJ. The media has covered for Obamas massive failure. Can you imagine if this was another Pres? Pervert alert.  @RepWeiner is back on twitter. All girls under the age of 18, block him immediately. Amazing, various celebrities were far harsher than me with political statements--- but media doesn't care about... http://t.co/eKaTfj5l It's freezing and snowing in New York--we need global warming! We have to make America great again! Our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together! Another four years--not good for the country but we'll have to live with it! This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it--reasons why to follow. Brian, if I'm "well past the last exit to relevance" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night? @NBCNightlyNews Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such. People will learn the truth! @NBCNightlyNews Brian, I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much--look at what's happening to nightly news. Brian--Thanks dummy--I picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone. Cable News just passed you in the ratings. @NBCNightlyNews The voting booth process was a total disasterit could and should be much better and more efficienttremendous room for error!  @bwilliams--wouldn't you love to have my ratings? The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratingsa disaster!  @bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night. Trump volunteers were out early today to offload cases of food and supplies for hard-hit Rockaways residents #Sandy Ive sent a 10-wheeler filled with 358 master cases of food and supplies to my hometown of Queens today #TrumpCares P.S. 42 in Queens is getting a truckload of food and much needed supplies for Rockaway residents #HurricaneSandyRelief House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare. Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years...stay strong and never give up! The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. Our nation is a once great nation divided! Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble...like never before. This election is a total sham and a travesty. We are not a democracy! Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice! The world is laughing at us. We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided! Well, back to the drawing board! "Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light." --George Washington Whoever wins today, remember that tomorrow we still have a country struggling. Our work is not done until America is strong again.  @MRbelzer is a stone cold loser with no talent--why did they ever put him on "Law and Order?" I love show "Law and Order" but the @MRbelzer casting is the worst ever. No talent--unwatchable! I have had the pleasure of getting to know @AnnDRomney & @MittRomney this past year. They love America. Let's push them over the top today. Do we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off? Make America strong, vote for @MittRomney. The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina. There is no excuse why people don't have electricity or fuel yet.  @ABFalecbaldwin  Alec--it's not science, it's a con--read the e-mails. The federal gov. has handled Sandy worse than Katrina.  There is no excuse why people dont have electricity or fuel yet. Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public. He can't. Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9.12 http://t.co/hy6O6r8F What took @CBS so long to release this footage? If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately. Now Chinese state run companies are taking over our coal market http://t.co/0FN95eO0  China wants to deplete our resources here at home. Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ & Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY & NJ are still decimated by Sandy.  Wrong! Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote. If you have any problems, notify the poll workers. More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama. Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen Change cant be measured in speeches.  It is measured in achievements. -- @MittRomney yesterday in Fairfax, VA. My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the close election, the enthusiasm gap between Mitt & Obama & the fiscal cliff http://t.co/0bHyrQGO Save Medicare.  Vote for @MittRomney.  He will repeal Obamacare on day one. Very dangerous pattern developing across country by Obama supporters.  Detroit poll watcher was threatened with gun http://t.co/XfJiqT6G Make sure to vote today.  Vote for real change.  Change that will deliver jobs and a free & strong America.  Vote for @MittRomney. The New Black Panthers are back at the same Philly polling station from '08 http://t.co/LIBmCVDs  Don't let them intimidate you! In the 1950s our climate was far more unstable than it has been over the last 5 years. The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive. Watch this behind the scenes video of @IvankaTrump's Fall 2012 collection photo shoot- http://t.co/y7nkj5OH Me voting--- it really is my hair! http://t.co/CbZzVeSc Remember: Obama turned down $5M to charity which I said I would increase by 10X to $50M--just to show simple records. He's hiding lots! "If you voted for Obama in 2008 to prove you were not a racist then vote for Romney in 2012 to prove you are not stupid." Thanks Walter D! The Apprentice was the #1 show on television last season on Sunday from 10 to 11 --- congratulations Donald! Despite the upcoming election, the cover of paper-thin Time Magazine looks like an ad for the movie Lincoln--sad! Before you vote, think: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more! Why is Obama playing basketball today? That is why our country is in trouble! I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight --- win, lose, or draw, Ill be there! Answer to your questions- I will be voting at 10:30 AM at Lighthouse International 110 East 60th Street, Manhattan Go out and vote--- this will be the most important election of our time! Tune in for #TrumpTuesday on @SquawkCNBC tomorrow morning. Benghazi is bigger than Watergate.  Dont let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die.  Kick him out of office tomorrow. The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy. How would the press cover this if a Republican was President. China is worried. The polls are trending for @MittRomney. They wont be able to steal from us anymore.  @ABFAlecBaldwin  P.S. Your brother @StephenBaldwin7 is doing very well on @ApprenticeNBC--and he stated he "adores you."  @ABFAlecBaldwin  They were rising in the 1950's then went back down--they will go up and down through eternity. Voting for @GovGaryJohnson is voting for Obama--don't waste your vote! Tomorrows election will have historic repercussions for our country.  Make America strong again.  Vote for @MittRomney.  @mcuban Letterman @Late_Show had his best ratings with me--and you bombed. People don't care about Mark Cuban. After 13 seasons, @ApprenticeNBC easily beat Shark Tank in ratings last year-- better demos as well.  @mcuban, Shark Tank was shoved to Friday evening-- Friday is considered dead television. Besides, you are not the star (& never will be). Obama just stated "It's always good to ignore Donald Trump." I state he is right, especially when the truth is against him.  @mcuban Baseball commissioner and owners were smart when they didnt want you to buy a team--- but I dont think you have the money anyway. "I believe in the America that never gives up, never stops striving, never ceases believing in itself." -- @MittRomney, 11.2.12 Via @WSJ: A New Direction For America by @MittRomney Obama is angry, frustrated and desperate.  He said voting is the best revenge http://t.co/HFQiGRDb  He is divisive. Like Al Sharpton, @DonnyDeutsch apologized to me for calling me a racist on @todayshow--apology accepted! Don't believe Chrysler (if Obama wins)--see how fast @Jeep production will be moved to China--and I'll be watching!  @mcuban When Apprentice became the #1 show on tv you tried copying me with The Benefactor- a complete and total ratings disaster for @ABC. Only 1 mill. dollars @mcuban? Offer me real money and Id consider it. Your team and networks lose so much money I doubt you have much left! Dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself! In 08, America voted for Hope & Change.  Instead, we got incompetency.  Now it is time to put a real job creator in office. Vote 4 Mitt! Obamas policies have led to food stamp rolls growing 75X faster than job production http://t.co/VMJy9XjJ  We can't afford 4 more years.

This is a time for real reform for a real recovery." -- @PaulRyanVP Remember when you vote, Obamacare is a disaster! Make sure you get out and vote...most important election of our generation...go Romney! Trump Hotels are delivering lots of food to storm victims...we love doing it! Gary Johnson is asking people "to waste" their vote on him. Make it count - vote for @MittRomney. We dont want to have a recount in any of the battleground states. Obama will steal it. Make sure all your friends and family vote. Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years. 4 more years?? Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference. All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama. Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney. All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves - who do you trust most on @Israel? I think @TheRevAl should take this challenge. Axelrod was too scared. RT: @RonKaufmanIntrn: Kaufstache vs. Sharpstache. In the heart of the city, Trump International Toronto is the city's most elite property http://t.co/VPxSMj4z  True luxury at its finest.

Could be the hurricane helps @MittRomney--people are rioting in the streets over gasoline A wonderful place. http://t.co/utLZ9MTV Global warming is based on faulty science and manipulated data which is proven by the emails that were leaked http://t.co/5BeAhats Obama has destroyed the middle class.  In 09, median household income was $55,198.  Now it is $50,678.  Four more years? I have an idea for A-Rod---buy a home at @TrumpGolfLA overlooking the Pacific--will bring you better luck. A-Rod is now looking for an expensive home in Beverly Hills--why aren't the @Yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation?  @eagles should sit Michael Vick. He is a great athlete but less than average quarterback. Obama our Welfare & Food Stamp President, is praising himself for expanding welfare http://t.co/cAOUnJT0  He doesn't believe in work. "We don't need a Secretary of Business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and I do" -- @MittRomney Unemployment is now 7.9%.  Four years and $6.5T later, that is really bad! How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction. Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding. People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country. I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island & Long Island.  @TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice, apology accepted!  @BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly, I won't be able to do it.  @RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional. We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned!  @Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election. With long gas lines & total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama. It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama. Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral. It will be the best resort in the countryMiami is hot! I will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairnessmany people asking for this. How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?  And he continues to lie to the public! What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications? Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.  How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi? Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say! If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused. My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency. http://t.co/oK9SpIc7 Press release. Video response to follow. http://t.co/3Xz74ipi I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public. President Obama missed the deadline! Obama is a terrible negotiator. He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will! Why is Obamas auto bailout now creating jobs in China?  He is ruining American industry. To all @MittRomney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can GOTV on election day. Romneys $2 Billion Sacrifice for America By Chris Ruddy @Newsmax_Media http://t.co/ZlDYNMa1 You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't. Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming. China is so happy! Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane? From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast. It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity! "The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way." -- Dale Carnegie Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break. A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.  The onus is on Obama to first release his records. President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer! President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow. It is so easy and could do so much good! Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy. My honor. Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister, @NewYorkPost, @NewYorkObserver & @NashuaTelegraph endorsements! Spoiler--@dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice... #TRUMP International Reality will be Americas premiere real estate brokerage house http://t.co/joOBdhFU  w/ the most distinctive services. How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--& his ratings stink. You'd think @HBO could do a lot better. A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obamas lack of transparency. I don't blame them. There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obamas choice, once he releases all of his records. Looking at the figures and plans behind @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film makes you realize how stupid @AOL (cont) http://t.co/rO04RZDP  @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides.  Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue. In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9.11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi. Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ. Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater. How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week? Another scandal ignored by the liberal media. http://t.co/eXJyiGeB Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article. If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star. An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel-  http://t.co/yt7LPuME A must read by friends and foes of President Obama. End date is tomorrow at noon.  @oreillyfactor called me a "master marketeer" last night--I am not. I am a great builder--I build great things & people come. Part 2 of my @jimmyfallon interview giving away some @CelebApprentice spoilers & discussing 2012 Miss Universe Pageant http://t.co/8o8nz1PD Part 1 of my @jimmyfallon interview discussing my $5M offer to Obama, #TRUMP Tower atrium, my tweets & 57th st. crane http://t.co/AvLO9Inf Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific. A champion! I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star, Kevin Garnett @Celtics, said to a crowd "Forget Shaq, I want to meet Donald Trump." Watch the clip from @Late_Show where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency http://t.co/02ABDshA I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go. The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity. Looking like he won't be doing it. What is he hiding? Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
Photo: Lloyd Bishop/NBC http://t.co/P8yJrMqH The polls & momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney. Don't let the hurricane change your thinking! Fans shouldn't worry.  We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm. Chinas stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses http://t.co/LfATjhuf Their market gains the day we are hit by storm Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm? Scary.  Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.  4 more years? People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out. http://t.co/LYXCvaOl Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something? Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5.  Taylor is terrific! Lets be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday. How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9.12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi? "Without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything." --Midas Touch I never fall for scams.  I am the only person who immediately walked out of my Ali G interview Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders. They are American heroes. My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St. crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama http://t.co/ebUofUW0 My @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm http://t.co/Lz7tTurD These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP. Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history. The election is trending towards @MittRomney. Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline. So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you! http://t.co/0tf8Pm0n The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks, staff! Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more! Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states. People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others, I stayed open. http://t.co/ONelqemC I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast. Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday. Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it. Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars. I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm. The water damage to NYC is amazing. The winds were bad but the water was worse. All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below, move out! If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office. Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze. http://t.co/fHVEFZd9 We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge. Free coffee and food. So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news. Let's see what happens later. Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama. Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible! I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country. The storm could be very good for him as he (cont) http://t.co/BbBpnYfY Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute. He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies. Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was "probably" born in the US--the word "probably" is a disaster for Obama. I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. What people don't know about @BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early (cont) http://t.co/EMsJd6kP I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno. Bill, you are no Letterman. While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct.  @BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't. Is this a double standard? Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree. A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama. Alert...The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi. He did nothing...he is no leader. I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement. I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President. The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show I know more about people who get ratings than anyone. Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was professionally dead. I saved her tiny... http://t.co/aRI9KZf4 I hear they are very unhappy w/ Arianna and @huffingtonpost at @AOL. Ill bet she wont be there for long!

No one approves (cont) http://t.co/9TTwQFlI If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say?

My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day. Know you can! Must win Ohio. Where's the transparency? Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright. Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd. It will be great fun. Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write. By the way, where is @Oprah? Good question. 4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent. Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah. ...Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester. The Middle East is a mess. Yet Colin Powell still endorses him. Wonder why? Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election! Would be a horrible thing to do. The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney. He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding. VOTE! Wow! Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest? DJT One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer & give $1,250,000 to each family of the four... http://t.co/TMPHmSy7 Watch me explain on the @Late_Show how my charitable offer to Obama changes the election and is about transparency http://t.co/UblNbPat A clip from last night's @Late_Show where I detail my charitable offer to Obama and Dave describes his terrible grades http://t.co/02ABDshA What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost. How much longer will Arianna last--I predict not much. Stupid Arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once-great NYTimes Business Section... ...a real loser named Tim O'Brien--and it's never recovered. Dopey Arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me--boring story after boring story...but I hear she is in big trouble! I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100... ... I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek. The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity.... http://t.co/FjVYwWR4  @SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor! Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain.... ....instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause. Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi. Letterman @Late_Show was great last night. I had a lot of fun. You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity. "The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants." --The America We Deserve It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent. Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30. 1st nite of Sweeps.Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before. Enjoy Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires... For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go. Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants "wind turbines manufactured here in China" http://t.co/Fe2gkSlg I don't think this was a gaffe. China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports http://t.co/eShZeqgZ  We need @MittRomney to rein them in. I hope Derek Jeters recovery is going well.  He is a very special player and a great guy.  New York loves him. @yankees "Trump Offers To Donate $5 Million To Charity If Obama Releases College Transcripts" http://t.co/8l3BpZf6 via @rcpvideo What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.  @Mark_Sanchez shouldnt be too upset over @EvaLongoria.  He will always do great! I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.  Everyone wins.  Take the deal. Our side needs Donald Trump. -- @AnnCoulter on @seanhannitys show last night.  Thanks Ann.  @BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv--Why did you choose me as one of the 10 Most Fascinating People of the Year last season (and more than once?)  @BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv will apologize to me just like she did when I was right about @Rosie. Besides, I get great ratings on The View.  @BarbaraJWalters @theviewtv  Barbara, unfortunately you've missed the entire point of my announcement--you just don't get it! Still waiting for an explanation about why @GiulianaRancic & @BillRancic did not name their son Donald.  Unbelievable. Miss Universe 2012 Pageant will be airing live on @nbc & @Telemundo december 19th. Open invite stands for Robert Pattinson. Excited to announce that @GiulianaRancic & @BravoAndy will be hosting the 2012 Miss Universe Pageant. Great ratings for Miss Universe. How does @michellemalkin get a conservative platform? She is a dummy--just look at her past. I am happy to have started #ObamasFavoriteCharity. Really enjoying reading everyone's tweets. My @gretawire interview discussing my $5M charitable offer to Obama, his lack of transparency & my tremendous support http://t.co/vWcygF7f "TRUMPS BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: HELL GIVE $5 MILLION TO CHARITY OF OBAMAS CHOICE IF..." http://t.co/nnRuiikv By @billyhallowell @theblaze "Donald Trump Announcement: $5 Million for Obama College Records" http://t.co/6u4mLrTs  via @Newsmax_Media "Trump offers $5 million for Obama college, passport records" http://t.co/9BnNCX4v  By @AlexPappasDC @DailyCaller Just stated by a total pro: "You are the only one who has the guts to say what we are all thinking." Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.  It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention. In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public... ... By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity. Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.  Why can't he release his records?  Especially when $5M is going to charity. I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.  All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records http://t.co/Cn8bn9LH #Election2012 I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth. A puppet of Obama? Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.  As Sean says it is an easy $5 million to charity.  What does Obama have to lose? Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive. My offer to Obama is about transparency. In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change. This our last chance to get the full record. RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give $5 million to charity if Obama releases records http://t.co/xCQbR1j2 Virtually all Presidents and candidates including John McCain, Bill Clinton, George H.W.

I only wish Mitt was more aggressive! Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen.I don't have time except to say "Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again!" Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing. Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit! My announcement is tomorrow! Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject! China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own! Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Ladens killing, not the President.  @MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night. Yet some polls have him winning the debate.

Very sad story--although they caught him red handed.He definitely cheated! "Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view." -- Steven Spielberg No matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit. He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record. I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges. By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening. 70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago http://t.co/pVppYf8l  At least someone has done well under Obama. The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more. Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night. Viewership will be way down. I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30. Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate  @MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward. Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight. Always treated me fairly. Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes. I'll be tweeting live. Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM  Pretty generous! Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K. I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi. CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs. Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see! Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart. In a couple of years, he will thank me. Be smart, Robert. Obama is an easy target on foreign policy @MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden. "This is my last election. After my election I have more flexibility." Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal. Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate. He wants Libya and China off the table. The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork. I keep the atrium impeccable. Key to its success!  @Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan. He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling. I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy. Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans!  @Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello. Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism. We lose nothing to try. Lots of autism and vaccine response. Stop these massive doses immediately. Go back to single, spread out shots! What do we have to lose. Via @politico: "Donald Trump claims Barack Obama bombshell" http://t.co/7UZEL9a0 Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday. People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda). Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work. It makes you hungry. Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable. I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight. Derek, get well soon, the @Yankees need youl. Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama! "They succeed, because they think they can." -- Virgil Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic. The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go. Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack. Respect the wounded and dead. Good luck to Derek on his operation. I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion. Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately. It will be lucky for him like in past. Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower. 7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%  @MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget.  Baracks @DNC convention is over $10M in debt.  What a surprise! No surprise, welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama. http://t.co/pHREg2Cj  He is the food stamp & welfare "king" Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which, under Graydon Carter, will be sooner rather than later.  @VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low, even for them. Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on "When Rev. Wright disciples go to Washington?"  Sad! Follow @MELANIATRUMP's jewelry line on @QVC site http://t.co/piYd3HTt Rev. @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son, Franklin Graham. Rev @BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney. Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night! A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season. They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner. I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did. You can't do any worse! Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead. Mitt will pull away next week. Obama has called Libya attack "a bump in the road" and "not optimal." Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth! Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year. Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC. Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.

I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned! Can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election. Time certainly flies! "A penny saved is a penny earned." -- Benjamin Franklin The Yankees are absolutely terrible--- what happened to this team? Hey @Rosie--how is your recovery going?

You can order them at http://t.co/oeCVxEGZ The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction. You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape. It's Thursday. How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects? Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man. When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good? Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states. Their internals must be horrendous. While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars, ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back! Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment. Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you. Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins. If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy. I think the @yankees will win today. Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure. I hope A-Rod plays, however. Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right.

Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. He can do much better! Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback. Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped. See what happens when I am not mentioned. Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles. Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there. While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded. But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout  http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish! Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary  @MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style. "Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries"  http://t.co/VAisvQlh  via @Newsmax_Media ...Bad decisions can be devastating. Obama was beaten but not knocked out.  He lives to fight another day. But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance... All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.  Mitt will remember the early helpers. If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically. Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are. Windmills are a disaster. Remember, new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer. Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care. Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities. Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost  http://t.co/9sL1WhVF Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay. I am a long time Yankee fan. Via @espn: "Donald Trump would fire A-Rod"  http://t.co/kom7x1ZP My interview with @RealMichaelKay discussing why A-Rod should be fired from @yankees & how to terminate his contract http://t.co/dlErLZAE My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--& all the "biggies." It's like having your own newspaper. My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth. Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama. Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win. Don't put it past him! Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively. Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't! Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal. If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period! I still love Derek, he is a winner! Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you. The day after he sold it, he broke his foot. At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do. I kept saying, why didn't he do it?  He lost me a long time ago. Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated. Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy. George Will said "best debate he ever saw". If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting. Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins. Good night. #debate You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy. Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.  @MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems. Obama has no answer. Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton. Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years. Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp. Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility. Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.  @MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential! Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices? Good response on jobs by @MittRomney. Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs? Why hasn't Obama created jobs? Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"! I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country. Very nice compliment--I agree. We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would. For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election? Great win last night by Peyton Manning & @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road. Very impressive. If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series. And I will go to games 6& 7 so they will win! Get ready for tonight!  @MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly. Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great. Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.  @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice. I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi. Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President.  @reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves.  @antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep.  @History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real. The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage. It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings. And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks! Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row. At least he is consistent. Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked.  @antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool!  @antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths. You have, in my opinion, zero talent. I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice.  @rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected. Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers. I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney. Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod. If he doesn't perform well it could be over. I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt. Gov. Gary Johnson pulling votes from @MittRomney--Don't waste your vote. Obama must go! "Donald Trump's back with 14 'Apprentice' All-Stars" http://t.co/Jhv9xFF9 via @AP Based on very popular demand, I will be live tweeting tomorrow night during the Presidential debate. "The invisible hand of the market always moves faster and better than the heavy hand of government." -- @MittRomney "Sometimes the best thing you can do is just let things ride, let time go by."
Donald J. Trump If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished! Obama is planning on attacking Romney on Bain in tomorrow's debate http://t.co/3F5Sqe6A  Mitt should bring up college applications & records "Romney, Ryan Slam Obama Administration on China Currency Manipulation" http://t.co/K6xUXSwa via @ABC Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator. He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us. A-Rod should donate his contract to charity. He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform. He is a $30M/yr rip off. Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid. Mitt's doing well. Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history. Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think. Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke-let's face it, it doesn't work- just makes you hungry. A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice! Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma? I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people! A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great. Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing. Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks!  @MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good. One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke. No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either. When I go, they win. Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win("Winning solves all problems"- (cont) http://t.co/2rVgPfmo Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher. A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat. Time for him to step up and leave. Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night.  @Yankees are in trouble without Derek. Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence. A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion. So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose. Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away. Scrape and paint before too late. Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup. Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer. Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series. I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win. Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won. When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing". I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win. "Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality." -- Warren G. Bennis When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important. I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again. Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate. "What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy." --@PaulRyanVP Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families. The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected. With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors. Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast. This will be something special!  @dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act. I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there. My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me. Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night. #VPDebate Doing the @todayshow with @MLauer was great- I really like Matt. First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on "compassionate grounds." Do you believe? "There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still." -- Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt ObamaCare is a complete disaster. Many of my friends have to scale down their businesses because they can't afford it. Terrible. "Wing bangers"-- the name given to wind turbines by bird lovers for the thousands of birds they kill in the U.S. British PM Cameron is making a fool of himself by wasting billions of pounds on unwanted & environment destroying Scottish windmills. Going over to @TodayShow now to introduce @ApprenticeNBC cast etc.-- watch. Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think? #VPDebate Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat. #VPDebate Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan. #VPDebate Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching. #VPDebate Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can. #VPDebate Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind. #VPDebate Get ready- this should be informative and fun! #VPDebate Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment.  @Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC. Support her campaign here http://t.co/sP2DCsqI Another sign that @jack_welch is right. New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data http://t.co/5wDEDsJZ Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription? http://t.co/upa00265 Who is this guy? It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election. How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today? So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince http://t.co/6KErqMup  Sounds like his book bio! Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U.S. history Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate...should be a great time How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?! Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place. That is the real scandal. Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb. Sean Smith's mother http://t.co/Gfppvzc2 I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight. Don't be fooled by his gaffes. He is a seasoned and feisty debater. If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch! Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well. $30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction) I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold. Brutal report. A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero.  @Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter. Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal Great move to take A-Rod out of game. Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs). "When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it." -- Henry Ford Must read article on Obama's illegal fundraising from abroad
 http://t.co/VQI57pcd  Foreign candidate getting foreign donations. I enjoy meeting tourists in #TrumpTower. People travel from across the world to see the five-level Atrium & waterfall. Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an "A" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy. Rick is a fantastic governor. Even with lower profit projections, American firms are still throwing money into China http://t.co/xRJlsxqB  Obama is killing investment. I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night! "You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird."  -- @MittRomney Consumer spending fell in September http://t.co/BG0U7bYz  Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked. A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win. He simply can't perform without drugs. Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding http://t.co/1XB8OK2t  Do people think this is fair? Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech. The honor was all mine!  Great people. DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate http://t.co/nkPWyb1m What is he thinking? 47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird. Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations? Media? I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night. 27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again. "It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes." Be careful of voter fraud! Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure. Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary. Be careful! I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod. "I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin." -- Mitt By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night. It will be very interesting, I promise. The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks Now that Obamas poll numbers are in tailspin  watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate. Mitts subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner. In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate. - Think Like a Billionaire With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate? Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates. Will be a lot of fun. When will the unemployment numbers be corrected? Sadly, after the election! "Donald Trump: Monkey business on jobs" http://t.co/JjVkVmNE via @politico George Will is a political moron. Last month he said Romney couldn't win. In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again, a lot. Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use. Also, not a pressure player. My @SquawkCNBC #TRUMPTUESDAY interview discussing the upcoming debates, the real state of unemployment & bias media http://t.co/p8U4JmYg Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices? California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow. An election-losing event for Obama. Greece should get out of the euro & go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.  @ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard!  @carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St. Louis Cardinals. They made a wise decision.  @jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE. Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice. Our fans will be pleased. Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you. Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.  It is actually double that at $1.1T http://t.co/QR8vZIcP  We can't afford four more years. Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses 
http://t.co/A8UyBknk Expect more massive unemployment and stagnant growth How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection?' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours? Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass. He is a great guy and player. At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate. Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter. He is in the bag for Obama. He can't carry @jack_welch's jock. Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama? A record 46.68M Americans are now on food stamps http://t.co/0acwArSn  Four more years? I would do same thing if I were China.  They want Obama. http://t.co/sal9WpKV My @foxandfriends interview discussing Obama's failed and dangerous foreign policy and the real unemployment numbers http://t.co/6Y1UToMt Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts. Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty. More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate.  A new record.  See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)! Looking forward to Sundays speech in the ExCel Centre. http://t.co/SV6KAS1E The team with the best players wins. -- @jack_welch  @acuconservative's #CPACCO kept up the momentum from the debate. @MittRomney even made a surprise appearance. Now go win CO! Now America knows--the Emperor has no clothes. Why would Obama do better in a 2nd debate? #Debate #Obama My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race. Glad to hear that @RobinRoberts is doing well. She is a terrific person. I promise to do a new #trumpvlog when I get back next week---- lots of requests. Thanks! "To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction." --Isaac Newton Scary & Unsustainable: On Monday the US added more debt than from 1776 through Pearl Harbor http://t.co/fZGWVH5E "Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts." --@MittRomney Bill Clinton has been Obama's most effective surrogate out on the trail. Congrats to @Yankees on finishing 1st in the AL East. Derek Jeter is great--good luck in the playoffs! I'll be in London on Sunday at the ExCel Centre to talk about success. It will be a great time for everyone! http://t.co/SV6KAS1E The upcoming season of @CelebApprentice will be terrific--a great cast. Now another Obama speech from 2002 with him talking about taking the rich's 'stuff' http://t.co/5gVYTUOY Who is this guy? Where's the media? Congratulations to Michelle and Barack Obama on their 20th anniversary. Happy to have just passed 1.5M followers on twitter. We picked up over 14,000 yesterday alone. It's great to speak to everyone daily. I'm eagerly awaiting the next polls. The debate performance could be devastating to the Obama team. Let's see what happens. Both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life. You need to stay positive.  @SethMacFarlane will be a great Oscar host. He did an amazing job at my @ComedyCentral roast. Wind farms are ugly, not cost effective and don't produce worthwhile returns or energy. No wonder governments are giving up on them. As a big job creator, I was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate. Congratulations to Mitt Romney. He was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight! "Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack." --Sun Tzu There's only one candidate who cut medicare and that's Barack Obama. Cut over $700M to move into ObamaCare. In August, 2012, Obama said the so called Arab Spring sprung from 'joyful longing for human freedom'  http://t.co/HgP9Kf1W  Good call! Have you heard? China just told Obama to jump. Obama asked how high. Obama's '07 speech which @DailyCaller just released not only shows that Obama is a racist but also how the press always covers for him. I'm always amazed when I travel to my foreign properties.Seeing the Trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal. I will be visiting Trump Int'l Golf Links in Scotland tomorrow. Always great to see the Great Dunes of Scotland. 
 http://t.co/zttJIArK Who is rooting for Obama more tonight--his campaign advisors or the press? Can't wait for tonight's debate--actually delayed my trip to Europe so I can watch. This is going to be a great night. My @gretawire interview discussing @MittRomney debate responses, Obama's hidden records, my tweets and unemployment  http://t.co/XGUc2w66 I am very proud of Ivanka! My daughter Ivanka is being honored by the Wharton School of Finance with the 2012 Young Leadership Award. Also (cont) http://t.co/mraKH93c Reverend Wright must have great hatred for Obama and the manner in which he was shunted aside. Obama called Reverend Wright his friend, counselor & great leader--then dumped him like a dog! See June 2007 speech--is Obama a total racist? Congratulations to Barack Obama for having 2012's debt already surpass 2011 http://t.co/0Fok04gl The cheap 12 inch sq. marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me. I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me. Where is the main stream media reporting on Univision's new expose of Fast and Furious? Too busy looking at Mitt's taxes? Major Mexican cartel boss El Diego was just arrested with weapons provided to him through Fast and Furious http://t.co/rFLwJBxy   Media?? A great article about how ObamaCare has even further complicated the tax code and will hurt housing market http://t.co/2Tgk3VIj  @ritter1025  Wishing your wife a Happy Birthday It's Tuesday, how much will the media continue to cover up the embassy attacks for Obama? I'll be on @gretawire tonight on @foxnews at 10 pm. Great to hear that @nfl legend and hall of famer John Elway has endorsed @MittRomney in Colorado. CO is a must win state for Mitt. Under Obama, Iran has taken over Iraq, Al Qaeda has taken over Libya, the Muslim Brotherhood now controls Egypt. Worst  foreign policy ever. Woody Johnson's comments that he would rather have @MittRomney win the election than his @nyjets win games shows real patriotism. The Chinese are now hacking White House computers. Why not? They already own the place. Big win by @Yankees last night to take control of AL East. Jeter & company now control their destiny. Wednesday's debate is day one of the election. Over 70 million voters will be watching. In Nov. '11, Al Qaeda's flag flew over the 'birthplace' of Libya's revolution http://t.co/wHonaVoR   In Sept. '12 it flew over our Embassy. Glad to hear @SethMacFarlane will be hosting this year's Oscars. Something new that should be fun. A clip from @KatieShow where I take @katiecouric's audience on the Katie Coach  http://t.co/ZhKkdqlj My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing how @MittRomney can win the first debate & the last 35 days http://t.co/5LAqS6tR If Obama mentions Mitt's tax returns in tomorrow's debate then Mitt should immediately ask for Obama's college records & applications Obama is trying to block sequester layoff notices in Virginia http://t.co/xXsMHcV7 Another example of sleazy politics! Threatening phone calls from Obama supporters are being made to the Michigan GOP office  http://t.co/bDlYuEit Don't be intimidated! Obama loves wasting our money. He just made another guarantee of $197M to a solar company http://t.co/efTeSrBC  Cronyism! Al Qaeda taking over Libya after we made it possible--really amazing. Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez said in a television interview that aired on Sunday "If I were American, I'd vote for Obama." Big cancer risk from new "environmental" light bulbs"--a big price to pay! Obama now wants to give another $450M to the Muslim Brotherhood. Money we don't have going to people that hate us. Moronic. How many more of our soldiers have to be shot by the Afghanis they are training? Let's get the hell out of there and focus on U.S. "I've learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success." --Jack Welch "Life is very fragile, and success doesn't change that. If anything, success makes it more fragile." --The Art of the Deal #TrumpTower is one of the country's top tourist destinations. Obama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers. Republicans and @MittRomney must get tough very soon. Only 36 days until the election. @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. Make Obama's terrible record the issue. #TimeToGetTough In debate, @MittRomney should ask Obama why autobiography states "born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia." Cyberattack on White House--- what's next? http://t.co/t9vhQRDk Obama lied to the public about the Al Qaeda attack on our consulate in Libya. He should be held accountable. "If we did all the things we are capable of, we would literally astound ourselves." -- Thomas Edison American incomes have fallen $3,040 per household in the last 38 months http://t.co/8xWU3DTh If you live in a state with early voting, you should be voting as soon as possible. Bring your friends and family with you. Sean's interview with Bob Woodward on @hannityshow was very interesting--Woodward was great. http://t.co/XfqXZyBh  @IsraeliPM @netanyahu delivered an excellent speech yesterday at the UN. Too bad @AmbassadorRice wasn't there. Brits spent $57.8M on the royal family. Obamas cost us $1.4B in expenses--including entertainment http://t.co/G2Nvr2ZH Living large on us. It's amazing how different all of the polling results are--not an exact science. "To be successful your focus has to be broad enough to think big at the same time." --'Midas Touch' with @theRealKiyosaki My successful acquisition of the Kluge estate was a fantastic deal which is already being studied in business schools.

Great job on the Apprentice. Be tenacious. Being tenacious means you're tough and patient at once, so it's a formidable combination. Keep the big picture in mind. There are always opportunities & possibilities, & thinking too small can negate a lot of them. Iraq was one of our biggest mistakes.

--Midas Touch Are you a young professional getting ready for a big meeting? Pick up a #Trump suit @Macys http://t.co/ils4Ysod  Look your best! "If you're going through hell, keep going." --Winston Churchill Someone must be fired at @AOL for that stupid deal they made buying Huffington Post.  @MittRomney must ask for Obama's college records & applications--why is he not doing this? China's Financial Institutions are expanding overseas.http://t.co/WOfGLvNL They will own everything if we don't stop them now. ObamaCare is a failure. Costs are rising much faster under Obama than other Presidents. Now Obama's campaign is guaranteeing 12 million new jobs during a 2nd term http://t.co/uTnOkmdd    More like $12T in new debt if he wins. A resort in Arizona is using sewage to make snow. Environmentalists are going crazy--I won't be skiing in that snow. I have fun, I love what I do. You should too. Find out how at the National Achievers Conference this October in London http://t.co/SV6KAS1E I hope the @RNC is ready for a Third Party if they blow this election because that is what they will face. They must fight hard. Does Madonna know something we all don't about Barack? At a concert she said "we have a black Muslim in the White House."

Huff post gets it wrong re: Ferry Point...the only leakage of gas is from Arianna Huffington. No matter how good the replacement refs do, they will be soundly criticized--they can't win!

Aspirin gets the best press of almost anything I can think of---fact or great PR? Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years. He can never take responsibility. Obama's new excuse for his failures is that you "can't change Washington from the inside." Not what he said in '09. http://t.co/xCnCD6RN  @brandonhardest  Love what you do and work hard. Andy Williams has died. He was a friend of mine and a great guy.

Today I spoke @LibertyU Convocation, a great crowd...
http://t.co/H6Zd9twG RT @MittRomney: I am running for president to get us creating wealth again--not to redistribute it. With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value. The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11. Time for Obama to come clean. Despite all of China's cheating, they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential! All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats. They want to influence public perception of the race. The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over. "Amazing Race" winning an Emmy again is a total joke. The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows. The Emmys were horrendous...the absolute worst show! With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not. The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart. Why did @MittRomney give his tax returns without demanding that Obama release his college records & applications in return? Just left Liberty University.

QE3, a political favor for Obama, will cause record inflation on food and fuel.  This hits low income families the hardest. Big mistake.

Technology has shown we have tremendous energy resources right under our feet that we didn't know about 5 years ago. The stage is set for the real debate--it will be very interesting! Obama should play golf with Republicans & opponents rather than his small group of friends. That way maybe the terrible gridlock would end. Filming for @CelebApprentice Season 13 is now into the 2nd week. The 'All-Star' cast is already hard at work. Obama killed over 100k jobs by not approving Keystone XL pipeline and Canada is now selling the oil to China--very dumb!

And as you know, I never went bankrupt.  @lightjzup  Industrial turbines are destroying our land. Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments. None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster. 20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending. It's Tuesday. How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record? The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran. With 49 days until the election, @MittRomney needs to stay on offense. He should not be apologizing. Deflect onto Obama's record. This morning @nbc @todayshow played some of the @RNC video I filmed for the Tampa Convention http://t.co/ogglpBfQ My @nbc @todayshow interview discussing my @RNC video & why @MittRomney should not apologize

While Obama is denying it, he did receive intelligence about the attacks 3 days before http://t.co/u78hfrJt Too busy campaigning? Still a buyer's market. Buy directly from a bank.

With 50 days until the election, it is #TimeToGetTough for @MittRomney & @GOP Teachers in Chicago should go back to work immediately.Rahm Emanuel has offered them a fair deal. Now they're just acting for the cameras. Gas prices have doubled under Obama. Over $5/gallon now in California. We must start drilling from our own resources to become independent. Obama is our unlucky President. Everything he touches turns into a mess. Some people just don't have it!

He's finally listening to me. Kate Middleton is great--but she shouldn't be sunbathing in the nude--only herself to blame. Occupy Wall Street is at it again- go out and get a job. It's actually easier work and far more rewarding. "Success is having to worry about every damn thing in the world, except money."
--Johnny Cash Weekly jobless claims are up once again. The economy cannot recover with Obama in office. Hey @KimKardashian--I hear you are undecided in the election. I can explain why you should vote for @MittRomney. If you want to know how to prevail through tough circumstances then read "The Art of the Comeback." First Obama says Egypt is not an ally.

Nice work! Welcome to Obama's America--record high poverty and an 8% drop in median household family income http://t.co/3jzUjcnW  Four more years?  @MittRomney should continue to stay on offense on the embassy issue. Obama, who put these radicals in power, deserves blame. Obama's convention bounce is gone. @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll  http://t.co/yOw3U3ja It's Thursday, how many more bias press reports will be released against @MittRomney? Why are we still giving billions of dollars we don't have in foreign aid to the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt? I will be speaking Monday, September 24,
 (10 A.M.) at Liberty University, to a record setting student body. I look forward to it! The media is pathetic. Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney. What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies. With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?! Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11? Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally. They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak. Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started. Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates. Wake Up America!  See article: "Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake" http://t.co/f7esUdSz If Obama was smart, he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month. He won't. Romneys campaign is being put on the defensive. He cannot let this happen. Stop pandering. Must get tougher (cont) http://t.co/kID8iQe7 With the high prices of corn to continue expect even more inflation on the price of food. Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had. We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy. Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble. This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President. Weakness, cow towing and not standing firm is provocative. We are getting pushed around and robbed under this President. "The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary." -- Vince Lombardi Our $16T national debt is now bigger than our $15T GDP. If Obama is re-elected watch for an economic meltdown in 2013. Deja vu - I can remember a time when our embassies were stormed under another failed President. Obama=Carter. I guess Obama's Cairo Speech really worked out. The Muslim Brotherhood stormed our embassy on 9.11. Imagine if Obama speaks in Beijing? "Those who refuse to draw red line to Iran don't have the moral right to put a red line to @Israel." -- @IsraeliPM @netanyahu No surprise. @DNC displayed Russian ships in tribute to vets http://t.co/Q6BpWj0I  Did they mean to honor the Russians?

Morsi in the White House http://t.co/WKhZV1Op  but doesn't have time for @netanyahu? OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas. They are always ripping us off. It's Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists? What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador. Demand their oil. As bad as they were, I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power. The Middle East is blowing up--we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us. Iran is using Iraqi airspace, (cont) http://t.co/HVtjKSNN Obama is a disaster at foreign policy. Never had the experience or knowledge. He is not capable of doing the job. Libya is selling its oil to China--I notice the Chinese Ambassador is very safe. I always said the people we fought for in Libya were bad news. Once again, I was right. Obama doesn't know what he's doing. His foreign policy is a disaster. Libya, Egypt, Iraq, Afghanistan--all (cont) http://t.co/TzsrGrEm An attack on our Embassy is an attack on our soil.

When will Obama next go on vacation if he wins the election? The day after. Why is the Pentagon wasting precious dollars on going 'green.' Complete waste. We need the best & easiest fuel for our military. I hope the @GOP realizes that if they blow this election the Tea Party won't be with them next time. "There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare." -- Sun Tzu "If Obama wins it is the end of the Republican party." -- @limbaugh Amazing. @CelebApprentice has started filming our record 13th season this week thanks to our big and very loyal fan base. Priorities--while fundraising and campaigning on our dime, Obama has skipped over 50% of his intel briefings  
http://t.co/IhiIaKPa China is an international pariah. They are now harassing Japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands  http://t.co/sPBPxwYY Why won't Obama release his college applications? Is there something 'foreign' about them? 84% of US troops wounded & 70% of our brave men & women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama. Time to get out of there. Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration? Where's the media? The onus of the Chicago teachers' strike falls squarely on the teachers & their union. Inexcusable to leave children without school.

One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom. But I used the downturn to my advantage. During @BarackObama's presidency, median family income has fallen 4.8% http://t.co/OqAgfiQ7  Terrible for the middle class. A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC. Next week we start filming the record 13th season
Hence, go with your gut! If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11.2% This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is: http://t.co/NY3DQGrT   Disaster. Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work.Not a real recovery, phony numbers There are now 119,000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July. The economy is still terrible. Today's job report is dismal. Now a record 88,921,000 Americans are no longer in the work force. Drew Peterson, a real sleaze, just convicted of killing wife. Change the law so he gets death penalty. Dems had a very good and professional convention. The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast! The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia. He will take votes away from @MittRomney. The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants, @GiulianaRancic and me singing "Call Me Maybe"  http://t.co/5HzwnSvM   has over 2M views. Under @BarackObama, 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps. Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1.6% of America's history, he has amassed 33.3% of the total debt. "We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion" -- @MittRomney "Forty-seven million now on food stamps. When he came to office there were 32 million. He's added 15 million people." --@MittRomney The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip http://t.co/T5xzkNuL  They have zero respect for us. Outrageous! Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released. The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years." Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt? Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium. Pretty convenient.  @BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the convention http://t.co/2F5BtROF "Donald Trump Has Given Millions To Pro-Romney SuperPACs and His Whole Family Is Cutting Checks to Mitt's Campaign"  http://t.co/SROnhIhF Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him.

 We must do better. Other networks are begging me to do a show--I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice! "Change before you have to." --Jack Welch Scary thought--is the sexual pervert Anthony Weiner now in Charlotte? Did he bring his phone with him? The Democrats dropped all references to God from their platform. Not good! Have you seen the new #TRUMP line of clothing, apparel and fragrances @Macy's? Selling like hotcakes. Great for Christmas gifts, etc. Better off? The $16T US debt works out to $136,260 per household, a 50% increase since @BarackObama took office. North Carolina is a fantastic state with wonderful people. I enjoy my time there when I visit Trump National Charlotte. I wish the 23 million who are unemployed were able to celebrate like the Democrats in Charlotte right now. Almost every T.V. show is asking me to go on--especially the @Late_Show.

Why does US doping agency destroy an American icon, @lancearmstrong, for events that took place years ago in France?  @lancearmstrong teammate is angry and jealous--he is no Lance. Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud! No surprise. @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans http://t.co/tJPJqsBV  Big mistake! July U.S. construction had biggest drop in 12months. Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year. What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago? OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago. Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term. Outrageous! The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago. They have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @BarackObama's term. NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama, 0% @MittRomney.Even worse than Hillary's old numbers. Is that racism? With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention, @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents. Scary. Record setting gas prices in the U.S. -- we're really looking dumb. Lots of $'s being made on us. The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info. Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres. Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote. Is this Hope & Change? A record 46.7M Americans were on food stamps this past June. We must do better. Why does @BarackObama have such a fascination with my plane? He is more than welcomed to come for a ride. Joe Paterno's family should sue the idiots @PennState that made that ridiculous deal--and commissioned the one sided report. "Be  yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected." -- Steve Jobs As I predicted 1 year ago, gasoline prices hit a record high today...OPEC is having a ball at our expense. Great going Andy Roddick! Another victory for a fabulous player. Brooklyn Decker is good luck. I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad...leave Clint alone! If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame, liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible! Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy. When will they learn that he is not? Andy Roddick...a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife. Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama. Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC! China is now deploying drones across ocean routes used for trade http://t.co/IBtQRcic They stole the technology from us.  @BarackObama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China." --@MittRomney I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious. They watch the polls. @MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore. We have all the cards. Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran.  @GovMikeHuckabee was great the other night. People love him. "Obama's ideas don't move us 'Forward,' they take us 'Backwards.' These are ideas people come to America to get away from." --@marcorubio  @MittRomney's entire life and career have  built  prosperity and growth. I loved watching Clint Eastwood last night--he was terrific! "If you accept the expectations of others, especially negative ones, then you will never change the outcome."  -- Michael Jordan Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend. @BarackObama could have stopped this. It's Friday, how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today? A fact--golfers don't get aches & pains like others who don't golf. It is amazingly remedial. Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech. Chris has completely lost it. Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment. Too busy playing golf? @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic  signature to the parents of fallen SEALs   http://t.co/ELKcqTyr I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President. Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie. I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech. Joe should call in sick for the VP debate. "After four  years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney." @PaulRyanVP The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil! "Let me say it as clearly as possible, that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me." -- @GovMike Huckabee Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech. Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better. Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice. We really have something amazing for the fans this year. Gas prices are way too high. With an economy contracting and lower demand, how do OPEC & the speculators get away with this?! Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden  http://t.co/UkCnZrrJ It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us? I was putting together my early deals in New York & I was advised by many that I was too young. Believe in yourself & you can do anything. China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama  http://t.co/mV75eJFy  Of course. Mitt knows it's Time To Get Tough.

I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision.  @FinancialTimes writes that "@BarackObama should pray that China overtakes US"  http://t.co/kAeMtnLg Don't worry, he is making it happen. The US Navy wants to go "green." Our Navy should use the best & most powerful fuel & not play games. Give me a break! As usual, the weather people got it wrong in Tampa. They just look for headlines & ratings! Media silent when @BarackObama  called @MittRomney a murderer & felon. Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts. Double standard!  @BarackObama has completely failed the American people. U.S. annual incomes have fallen over 5% during his term  http://t.co/sL82thBo "They succeed, because they think they can." -- Virgil Look what happened to the autism rate from 1983-2008 since one-time massive shots were given to children-http://t.co/lpq2SveJ It is very sad to see what @BarackObama has done with NASA. He has gutted the program and made us dependent on the Russians. Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend. He was an American hero. One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @GOP can't be pollitically correct. We must fight fire with fire. I knew Chris Matthews when he was sane and, quite honestly, wonderful. Now he's gone off the deep end as an Obama surrogate. @hardball_chris Why do the Republicans keep apologizing on the so called "birther" issue? No more apologies--take the offensive! "The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success." --Irving Berlin  @BarackObama is begging the Eurozone to keep Greece in until after 11.6.12. He thinks the world revolves around his re-election.  @BarackObama sent over 100,000 jobs and Canadian oil to China all because he would not approve Keystone XL. I am sure the @NCGOP will do a great job bracketing the @DNC convention. They are a tremendous statewide organization. It's Friday. How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.  @DineshDSouza's '2016: Obama's America' is expanding to over 1,000 theaters this weekend. Will be highest grossing documentary in 2012. !!

Disgusting--@BarackObama's supporters are launching an anti-Mormon whisper campaign  http://t.co/iOAu0nC0 Shameful but no surprise.  @BarackObama is bankrupting this country. His budget adds another $4.4T to the debt, putting us over $20T in total debt by 2016. Terrible tragedy at the Empire State Building today. Must have fast trials and death penalty for the animals.

Massive combined inoculations to small children is the cause for big increase in autism.... Amazing--@VanityFair survived one more day without folding. The clock is ticking... In any business venture, remember that branding is one of the most crucial aspects of your enterprise. Fight hard for that brand of yours. "Statesman of the Year" in Sarasota, FL on Sunday night--will be terrific--a total sellout. Wind turbines are a scourge to communities and wildlife. They are environmental disasters. It is truly an honor that His Eminence Archbishop of New York @CardinalDolan will be delivering the benediction at the @RNC convention. It's Thursday. I wonder how much money @BarackObama drained from Medicare today to finance ObamaCare. Great new ad from @MittRomney titled "Nothing's Free" http://t.co/FliU8TJb detailing both the high costs and taxes of ObamaCare. Today we just passed 1.4 million twitter followers.. It's sad to see once decent newspapers like @USAToday failing so badly. I just don't know if they can be saved. One of the best moves I made early in my career was buying the air rights from Tiffany's flagship. Trump Tower gleams over Fifth Avenue.

Congratulations to @Yankees Derek Jeter on passing Eddie Murray last night to become the 11th all-time @MLB hit leader. We are about to have a record $500B trade deficit with the Chinese this year. That money should be back here financing jobs in America. Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico. @BarackObama can't be bothered, he is too concerned with @MittRomney's taxes. Gas prices are soaring. $4.12 in CA. OPEC is laughing at how stupid we are.  @BarackObama was caught telling Russian PM @MedvedevRussiaE that he can be more 'flexible' in his second term. Russia thinks he's weak. My shirts, ties and fragrance are doing "great" at @Macys--try them!

I am tired of @BarackObama talking about @MittRomney's father. Why don't we discuss Barack Obama Sr.! Only three weeks until the new season of @CelebApprentice begins filming--great all-star cast. Glad to hear @BarackObama's attack ad featuring my plane is playing in North Carolina. Free ad time for Trump National in Charlotte! Distressed real estate opportunities can make great investments. You need the foresight and instincts to know the property's true potential. Every economic climate, whether an uptick or downturn, presents new opportunities and challenges.

Roger and Larry are good friends! It's Tuesday. I wonder how much money @HuffPost lost today--great purchase AOL Glad to hear that @JimTalent has put some strong anti-China referendums in the @GOP convention platform.

If @BarackObama really loved this country, he wouldn't be destroying it. He has ruined our credit and killed jobs with ObamaCare. US government's foreign indebtedness has grown over 72% under @BarackObama. He is bleeding us dry to China. The US government's foreign debt is at a record $5.29T http://t.co/URVNZ1Kj  China is laughing all the way to the bank.  @MittRomney & @PaulRyanVP get what needs to be done to reign in China. @BarackObama gets kicked around by the Chinese.

Good news - @MittRomney has pulled ahead in Wisconsin  http://t.co/CrJ8tEr7 WIth @PaulRyanVP on the ticket, Wisconsin is in play.

Jennifer Aniston is engaged--she's a great person and I wish her well. There are only 22 days for @BarackObama to drop @JoeBiden. Obama is not a loyal guy. I think he is strongly considering it. I still hold the all-time attendance and pay per view record at @WWE. Congratulations to @WWERaw on passing 1,000 episodes. @WWE is still going strong after all these years--@VinceMcMahon is great!

Watch @PaulRyanVP explain how "'It's irrefutable' that President Obama is damaging Medicare'" http://t.co/TeWHwTTP Nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy--a disaster for taxpayers.  @BarackObama is promoting ugly, inefficient, unreliable, bird-killing, noisy, neighborhood-destroying wind turbines.

The Chinese are illegally dumping bird-killing wind turbines on our shores. Only one of many grievances--we should act. The US GDP in 2010 was 4.1%, down to 2% in 2011 & now 1.5%. I guess @BarackObama's plan is not working!  @BarackObama should be careful questioning @MittRomney on diplomacy--how many times has Obama apologized for our country on foreign soil?!  @BarackObama bowed to the Saudi King in public--yet the Dems are questioning @MittRomney's diplomatic skills. The difference between @MittRomney and @BarackObama's campaign promises to @Israel is that Mitt will actually keep all of his. Smart move by the Democrats to have Pres. @billclinton play a key role in their convention. "There is no substitute for hard work."

I am confident when American public gets to know @MittRomney, the race will go his way. He's honorable & successful man--polls looking good. Price of corn has jumped over 50%. This will cause a jump in food prices perhaps beyond what we've ever seen. Nasty for the economy. The Audacity of @BarackObama--the Federal Reserve purchased 61% of all debt issued by Treasury in 2011. Killing our children's future. The Federal government has $2.7T in assets & $17.5T in total liabilities plus another $4.7T in intergovernmental debt. Have a nice day. By folding, Penn State leadership made things worse. The deal is ridiculous & punishes the wrong people. I hope the alumni sue to overturn. Amazing how fast all of Joe Paterno's friends abandoned him. They ran for the hills. Hope & Change--since @BarackObama has taken office, the US debt has increased by an average of $64K per taxpayer. US Gov't is on the hook for more than a third of the world's entire debt & we wonder why China & OPEC are laughing all the way to the bank!

You're in charge--everything starts with you. Entrepreneurs: Be ready for problems--you'll have them every day. Keep open to new ideas--that's where innovation begins. #3.  Look at the solution, not the problem. Learn to focus on what will give results. #2.  Keep your momentum. Without momentum, a lot of great ideas go nowhere. #1. Keep the big picture in mind.

Is derived from winning! Show me someone without an ego, and I'll show you a loser - having a healthy ego, or high opinion of yourself, is a real positive in life! In making big money, knowledge is far more important than any other ingredient, including money itself! My father Fred Trump left me a relatively small amount of money (compared to where I am today-over $10 billion) but vast amount of knowledge "@beandp749:  I like thinking big. If youre going to be thinking anything, you might as well think big. Donald Trump" "@SportsProverbs: Winners see problems as just another way to prove themselves.  Donald Trump" Don't underestimate yourself--or your possibilities. There are always opportunities. After every setback, start thinking big as soon as possible. - Think Big My shirts, ties & cufflinks @Macys have never been better or more beautiful. Great holiday gifts, great price. You can't put a limit on anything. The more you dream, the farther you get. - 
@MichaelPhelps It's Friday. How much money has been wasted on defunct ObamaCare website today? The now $1.2B ObamaCare website is as bad as ever-- insurers not getting the proper data. http://t.co/W1zv7STHBi Looking forward to hosting @NaghmehAbedini next week @TrumpTowerNY.

ObamaCare website has topped $1B http://t.co/2IrbJtKR15 Will soon be up to $1.5B You can only smile when the losers of the world try so hard to put down successful people. Just remember, they all want to be YOU! With few exceptions, only really smart people are able to make a lot of money. Hard work is also important, but "brains" will supersede. I just filed a major ethics complaint against crooked New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman-he should resign from office! Too bad about New York Magazine, but there's a much bigger one out there, currently doing a story on me to get even, that I'll soon discuss! Remember I predicted that New York Magazine would  fold and people scoffed? Just announced (N.Y.Post) it lost big $'s & is cutting way back!

Can you believe that "President" Karzai of Afghanistan is holding out for more, more, more and refuses to sign deal. Tell him to go to hell! Despite the fact that I have had great success with the words YOU'RE FIRED, I do not like firing people. But ZERO on ObamaCare mess-no way! Why doesn't President Obama simply apologize for telling a big fat lie, announce that ObamaCare was a mistake, and deal a really great plan! US froze $8B in Iranian assets during 79 Hostage Crisis. Now Obama is giving it back to Iran while Christian Pastor is jailed. Don't do it! Happy Thanksgiving to all--even the haters and losers! Tell Iran to let our Christian Pastor go--and I mean right now. If they don't, there will be hell to pay. Make sure to enjoy your time with your family during the holiday. It is a special time. Love and appreciate your family. The $1B failed website is the tip of the iceberg on the ObamaCare. Over 90 million estimated will lose their plans next year.

I will be in Palm Beach, Jupiter, and Miami today checking on big construction projects. I love Florida and love on time and on budget const President Obama is finally getting hammered, even by his most loyal supporters and the press-I guess they can only take so much! New poll, WOW-53% say President Obama is not honest & trustworthy. What took them so long. Go back and look at his house purchase in Chicago Don't worry, THE UNITED STATES WILL BE GREAT AGAIN! Just got home, watching the news, and every story is bad about the U.S. Someday we will return to being great again, but we need leadership! The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it.  The Art of The Deal. Why didn't Obama, as part of the negotiation, free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini?  http://t.co/NRQHoDBwA0 Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that. Who would  you rather have negotiating with Iran--President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford? My money is on Ford. Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort. You're in charge. Everything starts with you. Don't underestimate yourself or your possibilities--keep your focus intact, and focus on the positives. After settling for a ridicilous 13 billion dollars, J.P.Morgan's lawyer is critical of the amount of the fine-why did they settle then-DUMB! Best book ever on dealmaking (or so they say) - TRUMP: THE ART OF THE DEAL.  Go get it, and others, Washington - you really can do better! I know it has been many years since our country made great deals, but isn't it about time we start, right now. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The reason great dealmakers do not OPENLY celebrate a deal, especially one that is not complete, is that it shows weakness to the other side John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one Tom Brady is a good friend of mine, a great player, a great guy and a total winner! Fantastic comeback win-this is what our country needs! Tom Brady has done a great job tonight-amazing New England comeback. Good game- not over yet! We had all the leverage in our nuclear negotiations with Iran and our leaders foolishly decided to let them out of the trap. WHY? How much longer are we expected to put up with the world's most incompetent     leader - ObamaCare, Iran, Syria, bads deals. JUST NEVER ENDS I will be on Fox & Friends tomorrow morning at 7. Will be discussing basic stupidity and incompetence, of which our "leaders" have plenty! I do not understand how so many of my Jewish friends backed Obama in the last election. He is a TOTAL DISASTER FOR ISRAEL-AND ALWAYS WILL BE How far has the United States gone down when we are reduced to accept the imbecilic deal just agreed to with Iran. Read THE ART OF THE DEAL! What a rotten deal we made with Iran. We get nothing (except laughter at our stupidity). They get everything, including delay and big cash! They changed the name global warming to climate change because the concept of global warming just wasn't working! The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare! Snow and ice, freezing weather, in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma - what the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING? Get smart on knockout assaults and crime - we have to be slightly more vicious (and violent) than the assaulter-and crime would end FAST! The scum that gets high on badly hurting old ladies and others through knockout assaults wouldn't feel that way with a gun at their head! We are using the absolute wrong negotiating technique with respect to the Iran nuclear talks. Strengthen sanctions until GREAT deal is made! Young entrepreneurs  keep positive. Dont let the ObamaCare disaster stop your endeavors. There are great opportunities out there. Its Friday. How many millions has the White House wasted on the ObamaCare website today? Republicans have the right approach to ObamaCare  let it fail.  Free market solutions will be embraced by Americans in 2016. Such a nice article in the New York Times about a wonderful developer, Arthur Zeckendorf  http://t.co/RyuH1k1gpB Thomas Jefferson wrote the Senate filibuster rule.

If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)! Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!

I will be going to Trump National Doral in Miami early today to check on the construction of the hotel and the new Blue Monster. AMAZING! How did the NCAA, which is weak and becoming irrelevant, extract such a big & reputation shattering settlement from Penn State. Others zero! Maybe some of the dead voters who helped get President Obama elected can be brought back to life after signing up for ObamaCare. The wimps that run Penn State should be forced to resign (and be sued) for the pathetic settlement they made and destruction of great legacy I wonder if the Rutgers coach who had the audacity to yell at the player is a proponent of global warming? Football coaches are no longer allowed to scream and yell at their players because it is discriminatory,racist and can be viewed as bullying I wonder what the late, great Vince Lombardi would say about the Rutgers football player who says he is being bullied because coach yelled? "@ISaidKnow: AWESOME! RT  Again, more dead people voted in the last election than enrolled in ObamaCare. Congratulations America!  Thanks!

No matter how far down a path you go, if it's the wrong path, turn around and go back home - before it is too late. ObamaCare is on LIFE SUPPORT - it will soon be DEAD ON ARRIVAL - A bad concept that was imcompetently administered! President Obama is under pressure from Democrats to undo his lie on ObamaCare. His problem is that such a move would end ObamaCare. ObamaCare is one of the worst political disasters of all time - 4,992,343 AMERICANS LOSING COVERAGE, LESS THAN 50,OOO NEW SIGNUPS.

While I was in Moscow I see that President Obsma apologized for his lie, I mean statement, on ObamaCare!

TOTAL TURMOIL Drew Brees is having a great game - a fantastic quarterback and really good guy!

A level will be reached where ObamaCare will be so out of control, expensive and unwieldy that the biggest supporters will abandon ship. Prediction: The disaster known as ObamaCare will only get worse and Republicans will gain far greater power than they have had in years! Put Kathleen Sebelius out of her misery and lovingly say, YOU'RE FIRED! Let her go home to her family and rest. BRING IN TOP FLIGHT PEOPLE! She is so sad and pathetic that I almost feel sorry for Sec.Sebelius. She has done great harm to many people and must be fired. Incompetent! Just sit back and watch, ObamaCare is such a disaster it will fall like a house of broken cards. The website is the best part of this mess! When Obama tried to tweak his previous statement on ObamaCare he made it an even greater lie-even the Senate Democrats are angry with him! Brian @kilmeade wrote a wonderful book called "George Washington's Secret Six" that is truly worth reading.

Woman being cited by Kerry & McCain on Syrian rebels is a paid consultant of the rebels http://t.co/pavhGj9cIf The historic $250M renovations at @TrumpDoral are moving on pace. Once complete, @TrumpDoral will be South Floridas premiere resort. Remember the golden rule of negotiating: He who has the gold makes the rules.  Midas Touch I am not angry at Russia (or China) because their leaders are far smarter than ours. We need real leadership, and fast,before it is too late I wonder how much our "leaders" have promised, or given, Russia in order for them to behave and not make the U.S. look even worse? Really bad news just announced concerning jobs. Far fewer jobs created in August than anticipated. Interest rates, therefore, to remain low. We don't have the leadership, including the Generals (who just said the element of surprise does not matter) to attack anyone! Cool it. Did you ever see a situation so ridiculous as our President explaining what, when and where to Congress about a Syrian attack. Far too late! "@Jahbalon: Why is Sierra Club not speaking up for the birds slain by turbines? MUST READ from biologist http://t.co/kVamtIaYnM The terrorists in Syria are calling themselves REBELS and getting away with it because our leaders are so         completely stupid! We should not attack Syria but if they make the stupid move to do so, the Arab League,whose members are laughing at us, should pay!

I have just lost my beautiful & elegant long time exec. assistant  Norma Foerderer. She passed away yesterday  a truly magnificent woman. AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA - IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING! While everyone is waiting and prepared for us to attack Syria, maybe we should knock the hell out of Iran and their nuclear capabilities? If you look at the horrible picture on the front page of the NY Times of the "rebels" executing prisoners, you would say forget the rebels! Tell Congress to straighten out the many problems of our country before trying to be the policemen to the world. Make America great again! The only reason President Obama wants to attack Syria is to save face over his very dumb RED LINE statement. Do NOT attack Syria,fix U.S.A. President Obama put himself in a very bad position when he talked about Syria crossing the RED LINE. Amazingly, now he denies he said that! Is Anthony Weiner a jerk or what! Jay Leno and his people are constantly calling me to go on his show. My answer is always no because his show sucks. They love my ratings!

Congratulations to @PiersMorgan on winning @BritishGQ TV Personality Of The Year. Piers deserves his success! For all of those fools that want to attack Syria, the U.S.has lost the vital element of surprise-so stupid-could be a disaster! What I am saying is stay out of Syria. The great GENERALS MacArthur and Patton, real leaders and fighters, are spinning in their graves as we give Syria info & time to prepare.

President Obama's "Arab Spring" is not looking so good right now! Think of it, the Arab League doesn't want to get involved with Syria - but they want us to do their dirty work. How stupid! If the U.S. attacks Syria and hits the wrong targets, killing civilians, there will be worldwide hell to pay. Stay away and fix broken U.S. Our country is looking very bad right now! Eliot Spitzer has failed at everything he has ever done, and now he wants to be comptroller. Thrown out of politics and off of TV, CRAZY! Each time I see one of Anthony Weiner's television ads for mayor I ask, what the hell is he doing just wasting money & time-go get a job! In war, the elememt of surprise is sooooo important.What the hell is Obama doing. We have given Syria so much time and information-there has never been such an instance in wartime history. Syria is now fully prepared! Why isn't the Arab League paying for everything and sending troops? They want us to do their dirty work with no involvement by themselves! The Arab League stated that it wants nothing to do with an attack on Syria, but they want us to attack.Are our leaders insane or just stupid It is truly amateur hour at the White House - and this is why we should not be doing the "war thing" right now! President Obama's weakness and indecision may have saved us from doing a horrible and very costly (in more ways than money) attack on Syria! Did anyone notice that Obama failed to get a coalition of other countries to go along with us. He couldn't even get Britain! NO LEADERSHIP. Be prepared, there is a small chance that our horrendous leadership could unknowingly lead us into World War III. China is already preparing to benefit economically from this mess. They will pick up the pieces and make yet another fortune-& laugh at us! Obama now just wants to save face, Russia is now telling him "don't do it". He waited too long and the other side is much better prepared. Who are our generals that are allowing this fiasco to happen right before our eyes. Call it the "PLENTY OF NOTICE WAR" Syria has prepared for an attack based on all of our "talk" - they have moved targeted ammunition and supplies to new locations.Amazing! For the first time in the history of military operations a country has broadcast what, when and where they will be doing in a future attack! The President must get Congressional approval before attacking Syria-big mistake if he does not! How bad has our "leader" made us look on Syria. Stay out of Syria, we don't have the leadership to win wars or even strategize. If Obama attacks Syria and innocent civilians are hurt and killed, he and the U.S. will look very bad! Is everyone seeing how incompetently our country is being run by watching the mess with Syria? Our leaders don't know what they are doing! The ratings of The Cycle on MSNBC, a sad and pathetic show, are way down. If they fired racist moron @Toure, a truly stupid guy, they live!

I guess I'll have to start doing my Tuesday morning interviews with them again! The United States needs to fix its own problems, of which there are many, first! Let the Arab League take care of Syria. Why are these rich Arab countries not paying us for the tremendous cost of such an attack? If we are going to continue to be stupid and go into Syria (watch Russia), as they say in the movies, SHOOT FIRST AND TALK LATER! I wonder what the great generals like Patton, the big M, or Robert E. LEE would have thought about our stupid broadcasting of an attack? That said, the rich Arab countries should get involved with the Syrian mess, not us.We should start rebuilding our own country & military. Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria. Why can't we just be quiet and, if we attack at all, catch them by surprise? I give the President's speech a 7 on the scale of 0 to 10! Not bad but room for improvement! Why would anyone think Obama would attack Syria the day of his speech in Washington. He doesn't want to detract from his press & glory.

No @DannyZuker it's making you crazy because you don't have the guts to play the game. Come on Danny, you can do it! No @DannyZuker , just the opposite, lots of money can go to charity if you have the guts to play the game (deal)! Remember, @dannyzuker , you are not even the real "boss" of Modern Family - no big $$$$$$'s for you! I know you don't like to hear this @DannyZuker but the biggest nights of The Apprentice were far "bigger" than the biggest nights of Mod Fam Just got final renderings of Trump National Doral in Miami - there will be nothing like it in the Country, will be the best! I never heard of @DannyZucker until his very dumb and endless tweets started pouring out of insecure mind-but I have a great deal for him! I was just told by a television pro thay @DannyZucker is one of the truly dumbest guys in the business-he's obsessed with T-so many flops! It should be mandatory that all haters and losers use their real name or identification when tweeting - they will no longer be so brave!

Record attendance and tremendous enthusiasm- I loved it! One season ends and another starts.  Already casting for the next @ApprenticeNBC. Great news for charity--$13 million so far. Very sad that Republican donors were targeted by Obamas IRS. Isnt it amazing that Obama never knew about the IRS scandals until he saw it in the news?!

Last night's live show was so much fun. Congrats to the entire cast, they are all winners!  From beginning over $13 million for charity. Ivanka and Joan Rivers will be working hard tonight at the Live Finale - everybody must watch the OPENING at 9. "@Redcoat_Overkil: @realdonaldtrump But his hair is real!"  So is mine, asshole! The cast for next season looks really good! Just left the set of The Apprentice - the live show tonight will be fantastic - and something very big and very different is going to happen How badly will the Country be hurt by the three scandals and the very poor implementation and cost of Obama Care?

Just inall efforts to stop sexual abuse in the military have totally failedin fact, the stoppers have become the abusers.  @NYMag is a piece of garbage but I think it is very nice & charitable that they employ the no-talent illiterate hack @jonathanchait. Congratulations to my friend @seanhannity on @hannityshow 1,000th show consecutively #1 in his time slot! Great going! Celebrity Apprentice will be LIVE on Sunday at 9 PM (from New York City).Casting has already begun for next season. In other words, our military has a very big problem! Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS, including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there, kept the oil! DUMB Our very stupidly run Country better stop being so "politically correct" or we won't have a Country to run anymore! Many generals and military leaders are now saying "I told you so!"  They say this will have big impact on military strength & national sec. General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control. Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.What is going on? America's top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.Forces greatly hurt! Looks like we will have a pervert running for mayor after all - just what New York City needs - and he will revert back to form, always do! "@MzInvestigator: Great way to almost end the week.

Obama & his people did a brilliant job of delaying these scandals until after the election. Mitt must be going wild thinking about it! If these scandals happened before the election, Obama could not have won. I wonder what the next scandal will be in D.C.? Can we handle yet another? The three political disasters could lead to a major and complete political meltdown! The "lady" in Chicago that I'm fighting owes me $500, 000 and is sophisticated  & vicious.

If Jon Stewart is so above it all & legit, why did he change his name from Jonathan Leibowitz? He should be proud of his heritage! Whats funny about the name F**kface Von Clownstick -- it was not coined by Jon Leibowitz-- he stole it from some moron on twitter. Amazing how the haters & losers keep tweeting the name F**kface Von Clownstick like they are so original & like no one else is doing it... Most people think small because most people are afraid of success, afraid of making decisions, afraid of winning The Art of the Deal It's crunch time.

BORING TOM Thanks for the tremendous support for my shirts, ties and suits at Macy's. They do great because of really high quality at a low price. The Time Magazine list of the 100 Most Influential People is a joke and stunt of a magazine that will, like Newsweek,soon be dead. Bad list!

I promise you that I'm much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz - I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow. Who, by the way, is totally overrated. The mother of the Boston killers (not suspects) says her boys are totally innocent and were set up-I can see the 14 year long defense now! Lance Armstrong just got sued by the Federal Government-they want their money back-I told you so! What was he thinking when he did that int? Scotland does not have free press, even when you are just stating the facts-it's crazy!

What did you think of the boardroom? #CelebApprentice George also appeared on Saturday Night Live when I was guest host in 2004. A great time! #CelebApprentice George Ross and I have done some great real estate deals together. Hes a tough negotiator. #CelebApprentice Looking forward to @THEGaryBusey's book of "Buseyisms"! Romance or Adventure- what do you prefer? #CelebApprentice For you newcomers, George Ross was one of my first advisors on the original Apprentice. #CelebApprentice George has a real twinkle about him says @TheRealMarilu. Really? The shark should be scared. #CelebApprentice This assignment has been a challenge to both teams. #CelebApprentice This assignment has stretched not just the imaginations but the patience quotas of @lisarinna and @pennjillette. #CelebApprentice George Ross could be right@THEGaryBusey would be better in the adventure task than the romance task. #CelebApprentice  @TraceAdkins isnt excited about their ideas. Are you? #CelebApprentice  @THEGaryBusey is making no attempt to help. Is he in BuseyLand? Their team is short on help already #CelebApprentice How stressed are @lisarinna and @pennjillette already? #CelebApprentice I hope you are watching the Apprentice...tonight's show is great and Brett Michaels is back! Everybody loves @bretmichaels! Hes a great champion and this is where he should be. He agrees!  @bretmichaels and George Ross are back as advisors. Good to see them! #CelebApprentice  @TraceAdkins presents the NJ Coast Red Cross a $40,000 check for Sandy Relief. You can tell hes very pleased about that--& rightly so. Seems like the teams are surprised when @THEGaryBusey comes back. #CelebApprentice What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk! Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better. Once he is well he will say, "speak to my lawyers." Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it! I don't know how Al Michaels could have been drunk and arrested on Friday night if he was totally sharp on Saturday morning. Great sportscaster Al Michaels, a friend of mine, played golf with me on Saturday morning at Trump National, LA. He was in perfect shape! If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand! NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards! Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms, legs and worse! Bullshit-Pop gave me knowledge and a relatively small amount of money (split between brothers and sisters) and I built it into over 9 bill. Watch Gary B tonight on Celebrity Apprentice-some really crazy things happen! Getting back to the nicer and more normal parts of life, Celebrity Apprentice is great tonight on NBC at 9. It will be a full two hour show! You are right, the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer! I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away?  We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals, remember the killings-maimings I hate when the news media, so afraid to offend anyone, always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as "the suspect". The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass I just won a big Court decision (N.Y. Post) against some character who claimed I owed him licensing fees on success of my shirts and ties. Oh no, they are worried that they didn't read the Boston killer his rights and he may have a good legal argument. 12 year case to finish?  t Sorry,  the best and most beautiful ties and shirts made anywhere and at a really reasonable cost. Also, fragrance is amazing. GO TO MACY'S. "@Edincamera2: @AlphaTrebleSix @realdonaldtrump It's saddens me to know someone so moronic can become so rich."  Perhaps I'm really smart?

You must be kidding-zero chance he is innocent! "@mikeohio2323: @rob_bieber @realdonaldtrump Tell the victims and their families about this guy's rights.  Terrible! Get ALL the info,  then quick trial, then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people!

True, America is rapidly losing it's SPIRIT, and when that's gone, we will only be going in one direction - and that direction is down! China is pushing North Korea! When is South Korea going to start paying us for the massive amounts of money we are spending to protect them from the North? Our President must be very careful with the 28 year old wack job in North Korea. At some point we may have to get very tough-blatant threats I'm getting ready to be inducted tonight into the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden - a great honor for me and the Trump family!

Remember, I only fire people when it is deserved, not for other reasons! BIG NIGHT on Celebrity Apprentice tonight. IMPORTANT, starts at 10 P.M. as scheduled but NBC just increased all future episodes to 2 hours! Have a GREAT EASTER, I love you all! No, I'm saying that the World is paying the price for China's pollution while they make a fortune with their dirty factories! Very sad. Major article in New York Times today discusses the cost of environmental damage in China and how it is RAPIDLY GROWNG! Rest of World pays. China is the biggest environmental polluter in the World, by far. They do nothing to clean up their factories and laugh at our stupidity! We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it, which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us. What do we get from our economic competitor South Korea for the tremendous cost of protecting them from North Korea? - NOTHING! North Korea is reliant on China. China could solve this problem easily if they wanted to but they have no respect for our leaders. Current @NYMag really sad, not only boring but highly inaccurate. Use better paper product - looks like a death march (which it is!). Have a great Good Friday and a Happy Easter. Find out who and what is the best in your field. Identify the trendsetters, leaders and authorities. Learn the standards they follow. Achievers go for the challenge, so the next deal is what they're thinking about. They have an obligation to best themselves. Wisdom comes as a result of both experience and knowledge. It's something you can't teach someone else--you have to achieve it on your own.

Great piece on Extra tonight re. Celebrity Apprentice! Sometimes we do things to build up experience and stamina to prepare, but it's to prepare us for something bigger. Many of @TigerWoods friends were quick to abandon him in his time of crisis. Now Tiger knows who he can count on. Many people look at successful people & don't see anything but the end result.

Smooth sailing is not expected. Will Plan B miss Trace? Firing Bret was a tough one for me-but Omarosa doesn't seem to mind. Omarosa always promises and delivers high drama...

Their show is terrific. #CelebApprentice  @DennisRodman must be thinking of North Korea. #CelebApprentice  @THEGaryBusey is definitely different. #CelebApprentice  @PiersMorgan and @OMAROSA really hate each other. #CelebApprentice  @IvankaTrump and @PiersMorgan will be wonderful advisors. #CelebApprentice I cant believe he would choose @OMAROSA as his first choice! She is hard to handle. #CelebApprentice I always believed @BretMichaels was making a mistake in coming back as a competitor. I disagree with him but... http://t.co/7LtrUa2JMh  @LisaRinna looks better with her reduced lips. Good move, Lisa. #CelebApprentice Looks like @OMAROSA is up to the challenge. #CelebApprentice How does this cast look to you? Pretty amazing. #CelebApprentice Losers and haters,even you, as low and dumb as you are, can learn from watching Apprentice and checking out my tweets-you can still succeed! Losers and haters are invited to watch Celebrity Apprentice along with the many great and productive people in the hope that you will learn. I will be live tweeting during the Celebrity Apprentice at 9 P.M.  Also will be hosting Dateline just prior to Apprentice at 8 P.M. Everybody wants to see and talk to Dennis Rodman - he will be on Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9. Really bad article about me in the dying (or dead) Esquire Magazine. Totally false - lots of hatred. When will this boring magazine close? Is Chris Jackson as dumb as I hear - but I still like that he follows me like a good little soldier! "@legsidelizzy: I do wish people would stop RT-ing Piers Morgan. A life without Piers in it is a much better life"  Wrong! Remember, Bill Maher praised the animals who took down the World Trade Center and was fired by ABC. DROP@HBO until dopey Bill is canned! Everyone should cancel HBO until they fire low life dummy Bill Maher!  Get going now and feel good about yourself! Joseph Kennedy is really being used by Venezuela and Hugo C. in oil commercial!

It is just a bump in the road. It will pass.  Think Big Who would have thought that an @ApprenticeNBC champion would return to compete? @bretmichaels returns to All-Star @CelebApprentice... Only the Obama WH can get away with attacking Bob Woodward. Today marks the one year anniversary of @AndrewBreitbarts passing. Andrews mission & legacy still lives on. @BreitbartNews Due to popular demand, @lisarinna returns to the 13th season of All-Star @CelebApprentice. Lisa's fans won't be disappointed!

I still say Te'o did this in order to get sympathy for the Heisman votethankfully he did not win. Teos imaginary girlfriend is one of the great cons of all timeor hes very stupid. The interview was great for @Oprah and terrible for Lance Armstrong!  @Oprah was great-- amazing that she got Lance Armstrong to totally destroy his life. Why did he ever do that interview? Lance Armstrong did himself great harm last night. Lawsuits & failure will follow him! You wouldn't believe how tall and beautiful @_KatherineWebb is- 6'5" in heels. She is also a total winner in... http://t.co/F8Pyk326 Miss Alabama @_KatherineWebb stopped by to say hello today. http://t.co/JpnAzwu4 Trump Dorals renovations are right on schedule http://t.co/N0llzAsJ Once completed, it will be the top resort in the U.S. All time hit leader Pete Rose should now be in the Baseball Hall Of Fame. He has paid his penalty!  @Boeing stock went way down because of 787- so I just bought stock in @Boeing- great company! The interview with Oprah will cause Lance Armstrong huge legal and financial problems- sometimes it is better to go into a corner and hide. I'll bet Lance Armstrong wishes he didn't do the interview with Oprah-- he's saying to himself "what was I thinking?"  @HBO should fire @BillMaher and bring back @DennisDMZ- someone that is actually funny.  @BillMahers show is great for helping me get to sleep--- better than Sominex.  @BillMaher needs to cut back on the pot, and maybe he will stop making offers he cant afford. Dumbass @BillMaher has still not given me the 5 million he committed to charity--- we just presented him with a demand notice. Brent Musburger did himself a great favor by saying what everyone was thinking- he is much more popular now than before.  @ESPNs apology(Brent Musburger) was a disgrace to broadcasting--- stop being so politically correct! IMO--- Manti Teo was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy. Can it just be new age that Manti Teo fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax? Not believable that Manti Teo was in love for one year with a girl he never met- she then died. He is either very stupid.... ...or mentally troubled (or a con). Congratulations to Tom Scocca and Timothy Burke of @Deadspin for exposing the Manti Teo fiasco. The first ever All-Star Celebrity @ApprenticeNBC premieres Sunday March 3rd! http://t.co/52UMXtcE Look, I have always liked Lance Armstrong- I just hated what he did to himself, including recently. His life will now be hell. Lance Armstrong made a really big mistake by opening up to Oprah. Ill bet he wishes he had the chance to do it over again. Lance Armstrong was given very,very bad advice! Journal News readership is already down 50 percent over the years. If everybody sued the Journal News for revealing their info (guns)- paper would go out of business.

Remember, as a senator, Obama did not vote for increasing the debt ceiling http://t.co/wTQ96Itg  I guess things change when President?! Can you imagine if Obama had to give today's press conference before the election? He would have lost.  @GOP really blew it. According to many, and while nominated, I would have won the Emmy many times except for my politics. @PrimetimeEmmys Lance Armstrong is now going to admit guiltcan that be possible after many years of denying? Just go away Lance. Is @billmaher the dumbest man on television?I think so. By the way, folks, @billmaher is not a smart guy (just look at his past)he just pretends he is! Dopey @billmaher is in for a lot of troubleI hope he has $5 million (for charity). I am a handwriting analyst. Jack Lews handwriting shows, while strange, that he is very secretivenot necessarily a bad thing. The Republicans have been played into a trap by the President--they forgot the 14th amendment..... ...and will be very embarrassed unless they get smart fast. I cant believe @Denver_Broncos allowed final touchdowndumbest defensive play I have ever seen in football. Peyton Manning should have passed on 3rd down!

What were they thinking? Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations! As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson! Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now! Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a  leader, this would not be the case Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart. Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators! ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented. There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.

If youve looked over the years,Ive been right on virtually every issue from Iraq (not going in but if so taking the oil) to jobs to China By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response, he has singlehandedly made it target #1. How totally stupid is this guy? "@wesbart53: Watched his speech yesterday...pathetic. Carter-esque, weak. His delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero"  True! This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness! Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC. President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands. He is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead - it is tough work for him "He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else." --

Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One.  Doesnt look presidential and at some point he will take a fall. I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone. I hear they will be doing it soonlong overdue. Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March.Madness", and LEAD! Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare! The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III. WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever. Must be very strong to prosper & survive I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire. He has zero respect for Obama or the U.S.! Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity. Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers.

IT CAN BE DONE! While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World, President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball)! I don't hate Obama at all, I just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history! We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers, and that's OK-but how much are Russia & China spending?

Because of his big $ hit ads on me!  @JebBush has spent  $63,000,000 and is at the bottom of the polls. I have spent almost nothing and am at the top. WIN!  @hughhewitt A GREAT day in South Carolina. Record crowd and fantastic enthusiasm. This is now a movement to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/9Lr1v6vjJb I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night! I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  @RichLowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader. It's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much. The dying @UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out! "@hammetjohn: DonaldTrump - How do u do it Donald. No one could keep up with u at your pace. Shows how hard u will work for us as President" Iowa was fantastic last night, amazing crowd and people. I'm now in Florida, getting ready to go to South Carolina. Big crowd, very exciting  @CharlesHurt   You were great on @seanhannity last night. Thanks for the nice words. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa! The silent majority, is silent no more!
#Trump2016 #FITN https://t.co/VTAe68eQ1k https://t.co/IPsJPVH5JP Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical. The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper. Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate! I hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans & America! We need a real President! https://t.co/nw7BIAW7HV Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way! My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C. "Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/cEMKihLZbK https://t.co/SxuutW2onm  @jessebwatters is terrific at hosting on @FoxNews - he really gets it! Remember that Bill Clinton was brought in to help Hillary against Obama in 2008. He was terrible, failed badly, and was called a racist! "@IJNIPGM: No casualties. Just victory, victory, and more victory as you proclaim the truth that is in your heart. We love God and USA" "@sunquist007: @JebBush Why do u keep trying to attack Trump? Really dumb strategy! U lose, he wins! #lets make America great again!!!!!" Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster! Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now! Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX! The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong! Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST! Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!  RNC  @BernieSanders-who blew his campaign when he gave Hillary a pass on her e-mail crime, said that I feel wages in America are too high. Lie! The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change! R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW! It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD! "@CAC8438: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him. "@mitchellvii: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy." "@mitchellvii: Face it, Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi.

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate! "@greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive A new terror warning was issued for European cties.

Story: https://t.co/PBOKbGIaVB https://t.co/wm9Y7E9RzB Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE! The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.  @chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary! "@deedeegop: Thank u Mr. Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. So nice! "@JodiL792:  You know what's making my Christmas Great, Family/food/friends&YOU! I HAVE MY TRUMP SHIRT ON W/HOPE IN MY HEART for America" When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never! Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly! Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%. We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!  @deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more! Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!  @danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!  @HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it! "@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story"  True, a total distortion of the facts! I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  @meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck! Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better! Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time! Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill! Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain! In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD! Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs! "@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail A great Christmas movie & perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Story: https://t.co/qUpZphfhV3 https://t.co/PSeVbWUJIV Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays!

https://t.co/XIVw5LdTqv https://t.co/Sqim2YyoCH Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL! It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump  @FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative! The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad The silent majority- is silent no more! Remember the importance of VOTING!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/wBdSg5ab25 The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic.

Likeability way up. CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10 We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again! It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad! When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/TUDwrg6RsD Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge! For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly. Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic! Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased! Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally.

Classic"  @JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent. Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate? Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?  @JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy.

Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA! I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video. Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology! Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened! "@drdoucette: #MissUniverse DonaldTrump must be overjoyed that as soon as he sells the pageant it goes off the rails.

Great people, great new owner @IMG. WATCH. My friend, @AriEmanuel of @IMG, bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on #Fox! Tune in! It was really strange when Hillary was missing from the podium last night. Not very presidential! Hillary Clinton spokesperson admitted that their was no ISIS video of me. Therefore, Hillary LIED at the debate last night. SAD!  @JebBush was terrible on Face The Nation today. Being at 2% and falling seems to have totally affected his confidence. A basket case!

Going to South Carolina now, great place, SRO crowd. Iowa was amazing yesterday! The media must denigrate ISIS at all levels or youth will continue to be drawn to it. These are low level degenerates, NOT masterminds! The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders "MASTERMINDS." Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS! A wonderful afternoon in Iowa! Great people! Heading now to Florida - tomorrow, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure! Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud! John Kasich fell right into President Obamas trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame! Doesnt help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - hes almost last. I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easyhe came in dead last! Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart! Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun! I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I dont want to waste my money. John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic! John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me. Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

The phony Club For Growth, which asked me in writing for $1,000,000 (I said no), is now wanting to do negative ads on me. Total hypocrites! If the presidential election were held today, according to this @surveyusa poll, Donald Trump would defeat any Dem: http://t.co/wmfHKnNSWm" The hedge fund guys (gals) have to pay higher taxes ASAP. They are paying practically nothing. We must reduce taxes for the middle class! By self-funding my campaign, I am not controlled by my donors, special interests or lobbyists. I am only working for the people of the U.S.! Remember that I am self-funding my campaign. Hillary, Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED Hillary said such nasty things about me, read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion, no truth. Just can't read speeches! Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen. In fact, it wasn't even see through glass, it was black Saudi Arabia was "vehemently" against the Iran nuclear deal. Then today they embraced it. What happened? What did we give them to endorse? Just announced that because of "Trump", advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200,000, a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY? Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN. He is just a 3rd rate "gotcha" guy! Very low ratings radio host Hugh Hewitt asked me about Suleiman, Abu Bake al-Baghdad, Hassan Nasrallah and more - typical "gotcha" questions The Dallas event in two weeks, at the American Airlines Center, is filling up fast. Get your tickets fast,  before it is too late!  @MeghanMcCain was terrible on @TheFive yesterday. Angry and obnoxious, she will never make it on T.V. @FoxNews can do so much better!

While millions are being spent against me in attack ads, they are paid for by the bosses and owners of candidates. I am self funding.

 -- Henry Ford Wow, some new and even greater polls--thank you! Will be leaving Trump Turnberry tomorrow--place & Women's British Open are great. Will be back hitting hard tomorrow. @Turnberrybuzz Should not raise taxes in Wisconsin, but massive budget deficit.

I look forward to the debate on Thursday night & it is certainly my intention to be very nice & highly respectful of the other candidates. Just at a news conference from Trump Turnberry in Scotland. Everybody was there & will be all over television tonite. Back on trail Saturday Carl Cameron @FoxNews is the only reporter I know who consistently fumbles & misrepresents poll results. He has been so wrong & he hates it! "@Jennifer75AR @AmyMek  He's not for sale like the politicians are! That's why he gives us truth!

I really like the Koch Brothers (members of my P.B. Club), but I don't want their money or anything else from them. Cannot influence Trump! People like lawyer Elizabeth Beck and failed writer Harry Hurt & others talk about me but know nothing about mecrazy! How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt, who wrote a failed book about me but doesnt know me or anything about me, be on TV discussing Trump? Trump Will Make America GREAT!!!!

Very impressive people! I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states! Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting. We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY! especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more). They focused on wrong states Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election. Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations). He "doesn't know much" ... "@mike_pence: Congratulations to @RealDonaldTrump; officially elected President of the United States today by the Electoral College!" Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking! If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names!

Tickets: https://t.co/OJ8S7iVzFx The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election? Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory! Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there! Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P.M. Enjoy! Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker. Stay tuned! I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U.S.Senate. The election is over - JOHN WON! Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic. There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium. A wonderful experience, and congrats to Army! I will be interviewed today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:00 (Eastern) Network. ENJOY! October 2015 - thanks Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday! https://t.co/VEsgPcWq7z A very interesting read. Unfortunately, so much is true.
https://t.co/ER2BoM765M Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS! As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today. Looking forward to it, should be fun! I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!  @RudyGiuliani, one of the finest people I know and a former GREAT Mayor of N.Y.C., just took himself out of consideration for "State". Join me live in Louisiana! Tomorrow, we need you to go to the polls & send John Kennedy to the U.S. Senate. https://t.co/O0jtz0BKeL THANK YOU IOWA!

The U.S. is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country, Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable! Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse. Sad Our great VPE, @mike_pence, is in Louisiana campaigning for John Kennedy for US Senate. John will be a tremendous help to us in Washington. State Treasurer John Kennedy is my choice for US Senator from Louisiana. Early voting today; election next Saturday. "@TigerWoods: Cant wait to get back out there and mix it up with the boys. TW #heroworldchallenge" Great to have you back Tiger - Special! Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers. This is happening all over our country. No more!

Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail! I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse! The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306!  @CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do. "@sdcritic:  @HighonHillcrest @jeffzeleny @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #CorruptHillary !" "@FiIibuster: @jeffzeleny Pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame! Bad reporter. "@JoeBowman12: @jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist !"  @CNN still doesn't get it. They will never learn! "@HighonHillcrest: @jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes? Journalist? Do your job! @CNN" Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed! If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal. Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this? Serious bias - big problem! states instead of the 15 states that I visited. I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)! It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4-- In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally Trump is going to be our President. We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead." So much time and money will be spent - same result! Sad this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy." She then said, "We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald -- of position." Then, separately she stated, "He said something truly horrifying ... he refused to say that he would respect the results of -- during a general election.

We've had free -- Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted. Not so anymore! The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems Fidel Castro is dead! I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! Happy Thanksgiving to everyone. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Let us give thanks for all that we have, and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead. Happy Th https://t.co/RY9mGGjrXm Bus crash in Tennessee so sad & so terrible. Condolences to all family members and loved ones. These beautiful children will be remembered!

https://t.co/UFdLWtwBEQ https://t.co/MrPaG7OziQ Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high. I can fully understand that - but why announce? Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes. In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone! I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment. Not nice Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States. He would do a great job! Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal!  @transition2017 update and policy plans for the first 100 days. https://t.co/HTgPXfPWeJ I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer. He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done. Good news! General James "Mad Dog" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday. A true General's General! I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us? Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior The Theater must always be a safe and special place.The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize! Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing.This should not happen! The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad! I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country. Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story. Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win! I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this! Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible! Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice! Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice! The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it? Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena" This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win! Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet https://t.co/wPk7QWpK8Z Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government! Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot! Such a beautiful and important evening! The forgotten man and woman will never be forgotten again. We will all come together as never before Watching the returns at 9:45pm.

It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to. Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY - to the United States Air Force!! https://t.co/5Gwi1M5R2t I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC. Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates. Look at the mess the U.S. is in. Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama. Heading to Colorado for a big rally. Massive crowd, great people! Will be there soon - the polls are looking good. My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent. I said no (for now), but they are watching. Really disgusting The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly. They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag! Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well--wrong! Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!  @CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse. Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life! I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. He knows nothing about me. But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster! Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away. Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail? Maybe not! My thoughts and prayers go out to the @PhillyPolice & @Penn police officers- in Philadelphia. https://t.co/eyC3W1mweY "Donald Trumps birther event is the greatest trick hes ever pulled"
https://t.co/zvVQnxeiQ9 A very interesting take from @KatiePavlich: https://t.co/XaM9yEYCHL Just arrived in Texas - have been informed two @fortworthpd officers have been shot.

https://t.co/G5TMAUzy0z The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits! Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans! While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all! Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER! Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls! Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S! Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible. I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me. Never liked his style. Super lib, Crooked H supporter. Irrelevant dope! Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted! Will be delivering a major speech tonight - live on @oreillyfactor at 8:10pm from Pensacola, Florida. Great honor to be endorsed by popular & successful @gov_gilmore of VA. A state that I very much want to win-THX Jim! https://t.co/x4Y1TAFHvn MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou https://t.co/JIlNW7myEN Henry McMaster, Lt. Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly. Funny! Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.  @CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They
are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign. The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke! It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night. It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail. More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum. 
#AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain https://t.co/FxyBL6fO1h Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC. #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou https://t.co/sCOnny1fl3 With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted. Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Pea Nieto. Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS. Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media! "A rough night for Hillary Clinton"  ABC News. Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU! COMING UP @GenFlynn @newtgingrich on @foxandfriends Wow - thank you Pensacola, FL. See you Friday at 7pm -- join me!

Great meeting with military spouses in Virginia- joined by @IvankaTrump, @LaraLeaTrump, @GenFlynn & @MayorRGiuliani. https://t.co/00GNH9nLet Join me in Pensacola, Florida this Friday at 7pm! #VoteTrump 
https://t.co/L8Ui56dcrJ https://t.co/0ciDCuoFeO Mainstream media never covered Hillarys massive hacking
or coughing attack, yet it is #1 trending. Whats up? "@Ler: Message for undecided voters: Please wake up and vote DonaldTrump now! Trump/Pence very important save our America before too late!" As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP. China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible! The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special! Heading to Youngstown, Ohio now- some great polls. #AmericaFirst https://t.co/cGwDLSOFUt #LaborDay #AmericaFirst
Video: https://t.co/RNl7cfzkmN https://t.co/ZqRtbV4KRI Can you believe that the Chinese would not give Obama the proper stairway to get off his plane - fight on tarmac! https://t.co/FAldS5zZi5 President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals! Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening? To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs. I will fix it, VOTE "T" The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow.Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails? The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad! The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration. Crooked Hillary's V.P. pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea. A total lie - and taken over during O term! Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source  @CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals. Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside. Inside a large and wonderful crowd! I am returning to the Pensacola Bay Center in Florida- Friday, 9/9/16 at 7pm.

People will be very surprised by our ground game on Nov. 8. We have an army of volunteers and people with GREAT SPIRIT! They want to #MAGA! Just heard that crazy and very dumb @morningmika had a mental breakdown while talking about me on the low ratings @Morning_Joe. Joe a mess!

Hillary Clinton didn't go to Louisiana, and now she didn't go to Mexico. She doesn't have the drive or stamina to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Former President Vicente Fox, who is railing against my visit to Mexico today, also invited me when he apologized for using the "f bomb." I have accepted the invitation of President Enrique Pena Nieto, of Mexico, and look very much forward to meeting him tomorrow. From day one I said that I was going to build a great wall on the SOUTHERN BORDER, and much more. Stop illegal immigration. Watch Wednesday!

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated.Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D.C. She was forced to go elsewhere "@RhondaR: Thank-You Clarence Henderson for telling @cnn you know racism & it's not DonaldTrump https://t.co/fSBPxZU8Gu via @BreitbartNews" "@Patrici: Crowd at Trump Rally in Akron, Ohio is a Sea of Women, Minorities, Independents, Dems https://t.co/wm7HV8WPGk via @gatewaypundit Inner-city crime is reaching record levels. African-Americans will vote for Trump because they know I will stop the slaughter going on! Look how bad it is getting! How much more crime, how many more shootings, will it take for African-Americans and Latinos to vote Trump=SAFE! I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona. Big crowds, looking for a larger venue. I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records. I have no problem in doing so! Hillary?

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize! What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics. I will fix it! Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty, education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities The Clinton's are the real predators...

Full speech transcript: https://t.co/npswT6lbg3 Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass! HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument!
https://t.co/FNbCMmwLTn Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION! Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself! Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering! So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising, national way up. Wow! Thoughts and prayers to the great people of Indiana. You will prevail!

Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE! It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact,  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history! I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime! The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy, boring!  @AnnCoulter's new book, 'In Trump We Trust, comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is! Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally.

Irrelevant! Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street. Media is protecting her! I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them. Something very big is happening! Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!

https://t.co/bgBGPaKaqI Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad! "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it! Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose! My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary! "@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks "@PaulaDuvall2: We're all enjoying you, as well, Mr. T.! You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America! God bless you!" Nice "@need2knowu:  @willspeakout yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!!" We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres. I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th! The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest! Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee. Enjoy!

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

The media is going crazy. They totally distort so many things on purpose. Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more. Very dishonest!

Jacksonville | 7pm- https://t.co/zfxeNbr1nq During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They dont want them heard. https://t.co/EHRiLkQDWD When will CNN do a segment on Hillarys plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost? Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam. Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. https://t.co/gJYSSXtpaz Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors. #ImWithYou #MAGA https://t.co/iYM3CCWS2z People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something! The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life. Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary? When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department? CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton. Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm! Tickets available at: https://t.co/4nLjRGyFYw #CrookedHillary 
https://t.co/oHI6xrDJU0 So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said! When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea! This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart! Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice! Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable! "@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope." The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H? I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it! We crushed the original goal! I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our end-of-month goal!  https://t.co/n6W9Dm6FqY Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:
https://t.co/VZLDFy707K Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like! The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END! Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA? I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster! Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal! https://t.co/fUTugI2R2k Just got back from Colorado.

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, 
NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes. Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country. As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games. Same as last time w/ Bernie. Unacceptable! #CrookedHillary Job Application https://t.co/CKXkAlGSiV Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.

In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse. #TrumpPence16 https://t.co/WdHbnhhCbW The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech. He wishes he didn't make that deal! Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her! If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!  #NeverHillary "Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster! General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD  #NeverHillary Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD! No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street! Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

WI: https://t.co/LKc7e4VZkB Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz! Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO! Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough! The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD! Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st! As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. 
https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated! You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly I'm with you! I will work hard and never let you down.

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time. Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air! Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke! While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN! #TrumpPence16

https://t.co/EXsoUOsEP4 https://t.co/3ji7a14GSw Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie. If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing! The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN! I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.) Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD! There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite! Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
#TrumpPence16 https://t.co/gCzHX1nyxD The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me! I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs! Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer! Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back! Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA. Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing! The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight? I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam. Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did? Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich. One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove What a great four days in Cleveland. So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all. The police and Secret Service were fantastic!

https://t.co/uzBOm21Pug The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails. Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs! Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years. Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you! Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States.

VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again! Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania. Place looks beautiful! President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue. Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse! Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching.

https://t.co/pPNrzG8kEa The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like  @FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch. If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud! It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement! As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions! We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again! Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud.

Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening! Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana).

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way! In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement. Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse. I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA. Great new poll- thank you America!
#Trump2016 #ImWithYou https://t.co/aVH9c5QRwc I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan. Details to follow. If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions! Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking? Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge! On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others. Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!! Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. https://t.co/teoVCYXKOR Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!

https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out! Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry! This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need. Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities.

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C. Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City. Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come! The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit! Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT! I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out! Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy! My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews. Enjoy! Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while. We will be traveling to North Carolina together today. FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment. It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again! Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace! On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy! Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays? With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM! Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails? The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked! I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa! Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people! Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid! Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star! Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6 Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change! The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this! In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed! I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught! The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures." Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!" On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil! Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt! Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know. Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it! It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged! It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid! If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring! #AmericaFirst

The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!

the world ever realize what is going on? So sad. Hillary Clintons Presidency would be catastrophic for

I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens. Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S. Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.  They have bankrupted https://t.co/1COtt0RPY7 Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe. How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as
Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs. Hillary says this election is about judgment.  She's right.  Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy. I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton. Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess! When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees  @DJohnsonPGA We are so proud of you Dustin. Your reaction under pressure was amazing. First of many Majors. You are a true CHAMPION! Yesterday's failing @NYTimes fraudulently shows an empty room prior to my speech, when in fact, it was packed! https://t.co/iFuf8MdTEH How can the NY Times show an empty room hours before my speech even started when they knew it was going to be packed? So totally dishonest! Donald Trump's Speech Is a Game Changer. #Trump2016

I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday. 2:30 P.M. I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror. Hillary just broke-said she would now use! What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade. Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace! Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart! Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant? Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame! Really bad shooting in Orlando. Police investigating possible terrorism. Many people dead and wounded. Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career.

Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win! Bernie Sanders must really dislike Crooked Hillary after the way she played him. Many of his supporters, because of trade, will come to me. I would have had many millions of votes more than Crooked Hillary Clinton except for the fact that I had 16 opponents, she had one!

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women. She is a total fraud! Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions! Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great! People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media! Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change! I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie! The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN, is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors "@sareed59:  Our ineffective #POTUS has to make a speech in #Elkhart to make everything look great.

Reading poorly from the telepromter! She doesn't even look presidential! Crooked Hillary no longer has credibility - too much failure in office. People will not allow another four years of incompetence! Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions. After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(?), so much interest in it! I will be pres.

Do you ever notice that @CNN gives me very little proper representation on my policies. Just watched-nobody knew anything about my foreign P Bernie Sanders was right when he said that Crooked Hillary Clinton was not qualified to be president because she suffers from BAD judgement! Crooked Hillary Clinton has zero natural talent - she should not be president. Her temperament is bad and her decision making ability-zilch! Same failing @nytimes "reporter" who wrote discredited women's story last week wrote another terrible story on me today- will never learn!

Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE. I am getting great credit for my press conference today. Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc.

https://t.co/W7xy7eXcii https://t.co/km0rRYSDnO So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave! It was my great honor - they do an amazing job. Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave! I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so. Watch! So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good! News conference at 11:00 A.M. today, Trump Tower! I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me. I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!

Nice! In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary! Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H. If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court! The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate! Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's! Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do. Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit! Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them. Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me! I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest! The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez! The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her. The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH Obama administration fails to screen Syrian refugees' social media accounts:

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag. The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals! Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates.

Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media. Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.

Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs? Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad! Would be four more years of stupidity!

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed. No more guns to protect Hillary! While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government! Airports a total disaster!

Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild. I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance! Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina. ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president. 4 more years! I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing! Looks like yet another terrorist attack. Airplane departed from Paris. When will we get tough, smart and vigilant? Great hate and sickness! My list of potential U.S. Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved.

We support Trump because he is a true American looking out for #AmericaFIRST." "@sandrajeanne48: No way I believe Trump at 70% disapproval with women. Went to 3 rallies. At least 1/2 women. MSM LIES @TheFive" Michael Barbaro, the author of the now discredited @nytimes hit piece on me with women, has in past tweeted badly about me. He should resign I look so forward to debating Crooked Hillary Clinton! Democrat Primaries are rigged, e-mail investigation is rigged - so time to get it on! I can't believe that @CNN would allow the very nice Jeffrey Lord to be savaged by a panel of seven Trump haters. 7 to 1 - Don't watch CNN! Well, that is it. Well done Megyn --- and they all lived happily ever after! Now let us all see how "THE MOVEMENT" does in Oregon tonight! Will go back on for a final question now! "@mai_Ttag:  Great interview! Happy you had a chance to show the other side of you. Never change, never forget you are our messenger!" I like Michael Douglas! "@johnjohnlacca: Donald u have done a terrific job so far on the interview. Cannot wait until u r president #MegynKellyPresents "@manakoa:DonaldTrump, you are fearless! This interview shows you are the Leader we need. @megynkelly is a tough interview! Respect to both" I will be live tweeting @megynkelly Show in 10 minutes. Should be interesting. Will be on Fox Network! ENJOY! Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary! Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it. Apologize? Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal? If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race. System rigged! I will be live tweeting my interview with @megynkelly on the Fox Network tonight at 8! Enjoy! https://t.co/nlJssZeIWm I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 PM ET. It will be interesting to see how she treats meI think she will be very fair. How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U.S. history? Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy.If so, he should run,not her.Will he bring the "energizer" to D.C.? #VoteTrump at clerk's offices & 185 ballot drop boxes in #ORPrimary!
Closes at 8pm! https://t.co/ESGg1Qu68S
https://t.co/TqcNAWjP5l Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders. Will be another bad day for her! Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China, NOT WOMEN! Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run? What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back. I said no. I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you! "In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue." This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U.S. history! The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond. Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. Thats because there were so many positive statements. No wonder the @nytimes is failingwho can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me. The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends. 
https://t.co/qkK3LJPoQQ With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud! A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries." I set all-time record! Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie! That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is! Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run. Great new poll- thank you!
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/SZyZ8GkF23 The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong. Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration. The media is really on a witch-hunt against me. False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail! Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers. DISHONEST! Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece. Massive front page for that! Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women? The media is TOTALLY dishonest! "@TakingIt_Back:  @nytimes keep shining....the ppl will not let the media dim your light...we no longer believe them! #Trump2016" Thanks. Everyone is laughing at the @nytimes for the lame hit piece they did on me and women.I gave them many names of women I helped-refused to use "@MrTohNey: Leicester & DonaldTrump seem to have the same trajectory, both were written off, but they keep scaling the heights. History? The failing @nytimes wrote yet another hit piece on me. All are impressed with how nicely I have treated women, they found nothing. A joke! "@stranahan: Sheldon Adelson Pledges $100 Million to Elect Trump President - Breitbart https://t.co/aRXPHAlCLC" Wow, @CNN is really working hard to make me look as bad  as possible. Very unprofessional. Hurting in ratings - bad television! Great new poll- thank you! https://t.co/ytzesbCZas If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others?  @thehill  Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrectit is just the opposite. I will not support or endorse a carbon tax! Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more! Great meeting with @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Republican leaders in D.C. #Trump2016 https://t.co/R0NuOrZISX Great day in D.C. with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well! #Trump2016 https://t.co/hfHY9MdAc7 If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, wed have no jobs in Americashe doesnt have a clue. In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election! Isnt it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate? Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage. See mediaasking for increase! Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldnt care less about the American workerdoes nothing to help! Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the womans card like her friend crooked Hillary. See her dumb tweet when a woman stands up to you If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose! Thanks Piers. https://t.co/hiDDT9hV0j #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/CLhqgybbYR Goofy Elizabeth Warren didnt have the guts to run for POTUS. Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold. Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U.S. Senate. She has done nothing! I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary. His time will come! Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska. Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose! The Clintons spend millions on negative ads on me & I cant tell the truth about her husband? Dont feel sorry for crooked Hillary! Hillary has bad judgment! https://t.co/LhcIU6kmxs It was so great being in Nebraska last week. Today is the big day--get out and vote!

https://t.co/hGbesTbQci It is only the people that were never asked to be VP that tell the press that they will not take the position. It was Rosie O'Donnell who ate the cake in the vicious Hillary commercial about me, not Crooked Hillary! @marthamaccallum Why does the media, with a strong push from Crooked Hillary, keep pushing the false narrative that I want to raise taxes. Exactly opposite! Get out and vote Nebraska, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Get out and vote West Virginia, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I am lowering taxes far more than any other candidate. Any negotiated increase by Congress to my proposal would still be lower than current! I will have set the all time record in primary votes in the Republican party --despite having to compete against 17 other people! If I only had 1 person running against me in the primaries like Hillary Clinton, I would have gotten 10 million more votes than she did! Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beatshe had one! #NEPrimary #VoteTrump #Trump2016

I will be interviewed on @NewDay @CNN at 7:00 A.M. I will win the election against Crooked Hillary despite the people in the Republican Party that are currently and selfishly opposed to me! On @seanhannity show @FoxNews now. ENJOY! Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS, and China on trade, and Mexico at the border. Bad!  @KellyannePolls  Kellyanne, you were fantastic on @meetthepress today. Keep going - I will win for the people. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning.

https://t.co/MTu0GEM7Dx https://t.co/C7HhNvO01T Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name? Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts. Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clintons flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American. Lets properly check goofy Elizabeth Warrens records to see if she is Native American. I say shes a fraud! I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both. Response to @LindseyGrahamSC:
https://t.co/lSDE7LHc95 I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run. This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win. Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight! Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability. As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement. Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad! Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party. Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters! "@Ausbiz:  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain" So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan! We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America. We will do so by bringing back jobs! Can you believe Crooked Hillary said, "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized. Join me tomorrow! #Trump2016

Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing.

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun! Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work! Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary.

Biggest story in politics. This will not be allowed! How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary? Great anger - totally unfair! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
https://t.co/TvFgM4TqKj I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign. Bad system!

I will be in Wisconsin until the election. Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors. I will bring jobs back home - make great deals! If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock! My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions! Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show. She totally misrepresents my words and positions! BAD. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
https://t.co/SULeDE2PYp Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade?

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates. Try again! The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math.What a dumb group! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016

https://t.co/PuqiM93zOS https://t.co/fSgpKjwk2q  @DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC, fired like a dog! Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me. Not nice! Final #'s just announced in the GREAT State of MO. TRUMP WINS! New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates! Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter:
https://t.co/EKU5QMgjd4 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
https://t.co/0w4ldD7dW3 Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference? What is in her hand?? https://t.co/HQB8dl0fhn This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune. https://t.co/N5815RS1At Victory press conference was over. 
Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions? Can I press charges? https://t.co/qbW2RjkINX Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape? Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there! How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz? I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC. Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight! We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN! Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm! Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates After the way I beat Gov. Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me! "@PaulaDuvall2:  Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say. If you're for Motherhood, he'll be against it!" Just released that international gangs are all over our cities. This will end when I am President! Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must! A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American. When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn! "Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story" 
via the Gateway Pundit: https://t.co/batAmur1FD I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30. Things are looking good, had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin! The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals. There are only so many jobs we can give up. No more! See Lyin' Ted, even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio, not Trump! https://t.co/Okc8XajVnz Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming Why can't the pundits be honest? Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again. I will make it strong and great!  JOBS! Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children. At least 67 dead,400 injured. I alone can solve Happy Easter to all, have a great day! My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U.S. are now, finally, receiving plaudits! Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again. He is do totally biased. The things I am saying are correct. - far better vision than the others I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning. Enjoy! Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding. While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others! Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me. I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election. Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S., jobs are leaving. I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J. Trump. Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong. Illegals out! Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me. I had NOTHING to do with story! The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite! The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business. Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump! "@Tytan01: Dear @CNN, after doing a quick Google & Twitter search there are over 15,000 women's groups supporting DonaldTrump. Stop Lying." "@SpartanMaker:  Let me help you Trumpophobes with math: Trump: ($10.3B-$1.2M 74' equity)/1.2M = 858,233%. S&P: 1314.5% #Derp" "@theAgeofLeo: Your instincts on foreign policy & terrorism have been better than all of these so called experienced politicians combined." Top suspect in Paris massacre, Salah Abdeslam, who also knew of the Brussels attack, is no longer talking. Weak leaders, ridiculous laws! Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me. How am I still number one - by a lot? I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did. He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted! Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it. If I lost-monster story! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/PHgrT1Nl27 Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz- https://t.co/c3QEbexOwT Europe and the U.S. must immediately stop taking in people from Syria. This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it! So sad! Just announced that as many as 5000 ISIS fighters have infiltrated Europe. Also, many in U.S.  I TOLD YOU SO! I alone can fix this problem! "@Doctor_S_Freud:  @TheView They're all brain-dead puppets with skeletons in their closet. I say you go on and destroy them all" A dead show Explain how the women on The View, which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left, ever got their jobs. @abc is wasting time  @TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO" Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST! "@TimVincent56:  @LindseyGrahamSC Talkers think about the future, Doers are already building it" #VoteTrump2016 https://t.co/OoB38jypsD" It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO! Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right! These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better!  @LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing! It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run! We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now! N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on! "@DebraRakestraw:  You have over 2M followers more than than @HillaryClinton. This says something about how America feels. #Trump2016 " MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe! While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race! I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first! I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Im the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin Ted & others are copying me. Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Shes been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are! Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin Ted Cruz. Honestly, I cant blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion! Lyin Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas just another dishonest politician. Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted! Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices! Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way! Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs! Obama, and all others, have been so weak, and so politically correct, that terror groups are forming and getting stronger! Shame. #UtahCaucus message from @IvankaTrump! #UTCaucus

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels. He is being treated badly! Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was. Not anymore, it is from a different world! U.S. must be vigilant and smart! "@MyPresidentme: Here's Trump #AIPAC2016 in case anyone missed it. It is a must watch. https://t.co/cGCIYE7yZB" Wow, President Obama just landed in Cuba, a big deal, and Raul Castro wasn't even there to greet him. He greeted Pope and others. No respect Big Republican Dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach. I will be there! "@gamzorz:  @megynkelly Dont worry Trump, They are losing thousands of viewers and money. Roger Ailes will be telling Megyn to stop" So the highly overrated anchor, @megynkelly, is allowed to constantly say bad things about me on her show, but I can't fight back? Wrong! The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters! Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media? SAD! Will be interviewed on @ThisWeekABC this morning. Enjoy! The rallies in Utah and Arizona were great! Tremendous crowds and spirit. Just returned but will be going back soon.

https://t.co/1Yak4I5B7b Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2 Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me! Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO! https://t.co/suIfdiMg0Q Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful! With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?  @EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState
and now he is the one leading opposition against me. Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz  and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians! Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0! Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight!

https://t.co/1cJ7OFbQiz Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz? Let me know. https://t.co/ESdiEftWGs Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me. Focus on others Megyn! Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio. Two more days and Ohio was mine! See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday. https://t.co/HiOhRaTMbm Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!  @WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!  @WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough! Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win! Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad! I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel. @oreillyfactor Wow, just won Missouri! I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate, but I wish everyone well. Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins! In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$! Yesterday was amazing5 victories.  Lyin Ted Cruz
had zero. Things are going very well! Is this what we want for a President? https://t.co/2yYy6Nyta9  @RepTomMarino  Great job on television this morning. Glad to have you on my side!

"@DumpFoxNews: @FoxNews @megynkelly  If media wasn't so biased against Trump, he would've won all of the delegates. "@jsconlon11:  @BertShad @Foxnews @megynkelly I tried to give them a shot tonight, but they have the whole anti Trump cheerleading team." "@gregens21:  @BertShad @FoxNews @megynkelly She's choking on the results! Call her justifiable Kelly. Justifying everything she says." "@BertShad: Was going to watch @Foxnews for the primary results but saw @megynkelly - looks like #CNN tonight" Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon! A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false. I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again. In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary! Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now! Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down. #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday

Good morning Ohio! Some additional information from my daughter, @IvankaTrump! #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday https://t.co/H7sBEnSpYq Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.). Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness! "@wh: https://t.co/AZmCErLKCn WOW people are so misinformed on DonaldTrump character! Watch this video! Hillary and Bernie don't come close Sadly, this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan.

Video: https://t.co/wG4RgOi1bW https://t.co/oAXBvcKIsr LYIN' TED https://t.co/Q0qXDGCN1l The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers. They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check. Really bad people! Because Gov. Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue. Carly Fiorina- I agree! Ted Cruz is just another politician. All talk- no action!
https://t.co/08xkEBD8Be Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered. Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse. Ohio steel and coal dying! Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! "@alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump! DISGUSTING!!" Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures. Big problem! USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD?ssr=true Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core! In other words, education of your children from D.C.

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact! We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. 
No way to run a country! Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest. Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled! 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! On my way to Dayton, Ohio. Will be there soon! The rally in Cincinnati is ON. Media put out false reports that it was cancelled. Will be great - love you Ohio! Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U.S. If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust! Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud! Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered. Kasich is good for Mexico! The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America! It means so much to me- receiving an endorsement from Phyllis Schlafly. A truly great woman & conservative. https://t.co/11rEMu99qc Rumor has it that @politico is going out of business.

https://t.co/cNe0skpB5i Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ. students in FL. attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews. https://t.co/JGTD590pKE It was great being in Michigan. Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U.S.and protect car industry! Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment. Dishonest people! Leaving for North Carolina. Big crowd, will be fun! Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament. Amazing finish! I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads! Lindsey Graham is all over T.V., much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney. These nasty, angry, jealous  failures have ZERO credibility! Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me. I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out. Now nasty! How do you fight millions of dollars of fraudulent commercials pushing for crooked politicians? I will be using Facebook & Twitter. Watch! All of the phony T.V. commercials against me are bought and payed for by SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS, the bandits that tell your pols what to do "@ChadRowland3:  @jdickerson @FaceTheNation A solid interview and a fair one.

I will be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami tomorrow! Rory, Phil, Bubba, Adam, and Dustin all at the top! I would love to be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami- but even more so in Orlando with the #TrumpTrain! I am watching two clown announcers on @FoxNews as they try to build up failed presidential candidate #LittleMarco. Fox News is in the bag! Romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win. But they lost- don't know how to win!  @MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked!

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down. Establishment wants to kill this movement!

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people! I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz! Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem! I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year.

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters.

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again! The Evangelicals in S.C. figured him out & said no! Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President. Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm. BAD! Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication. He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog! Ted panicked. Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S.C. He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration. THANK YOU LAS VEGAS, NEVADA!

Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad. Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy? Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support! Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics! Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks! It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done. Many people are now saying I won South Carolina because of the last debate. I showed anger and the people of our country are very angry!

All negative! I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on?  @lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.

https://t.co/yZT3lSutt9 Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
https://t.co/eiBCld77tV I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2) Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful! I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother! Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't! Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses! Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts.

Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington & Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud!

Message from @IvankaTrump: https://t.co/SZTq1QOXEg How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? Lying Cruz put out a statement, Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech.

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching! Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance! He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT  @MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize! Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!

Join us Monday, February 8th @ the Verizon Wireless Arena in Manchester, New Hampshire! #FITN #NHPolitics #Trump2016 https://t.co/HVfhtJ6O6Z Watch @AC360 on NOW! @CNN I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire.

Watch: https://t.co/zl4sMjmOUc This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum. https://t.co/tMav17UGkf  @oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show, an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone. #ICYMI: @KarlRove & @oreillyfactor discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote. https://t.co/Tv0FNezxse Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me. He would be so easy to beat! THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock, Arkansas tonight! A record crowd of 12K. #Trump2016
https://t.co/MjtIq2ii0Q https://t.co/I9WkPN3pWm Stop the assault on American values. Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
#VotersSpeak: https://t.co/XRRJ0fMkNV https://t.co/c7EHokbLD1 Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies." Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace! The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud! This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud https://t.co/tRM7KUCrSU I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy! @FoxNews Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany  @cherijacobus begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy! @CNN On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!

https://t.co/oUg1ErD0j7 https://t.co/9Hb7JO3wrZ Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment! "@restorereality  Iowa is meaningless...keep pushing forward, run the table in NH SC NV and Super Tuesday. America needs you! #TrumpTrain" I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it! I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

#CaucusForTrump Video: https://t.co/y9Fa8Ut6IP https://t.co/bJ6a0t9Pv2 I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning. Enjoy! I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning. ENJOY! If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000. By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies! Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam! Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN! I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!  @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends  @bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends  @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz! The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Tickets: https://t.co/nU39QHzxxX https://t.co/xZlwspf6xe  @oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U.S. Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS!  @FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS. Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted!  @BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?  @greta The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols. The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories. Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people, including Karl Rove, losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- hes a winner!  @tedcruz Conflicting Stances on Birthright Citizenship [14th Amendment] Gives #TeamTrump credit. https://t.co/0x2qed7174 Wow, new polls just out have Trump up and Cruz down - he is a nervous wreck! I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem. Doubt! Ted Cruz is falling in the polls. He is nervous. People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks! We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook. A new topic everyday! Watch: https://t.co/NXWNOcWZgc https://t.co/52E3LU3W77 Leaving for Liberty University. I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd. #Trump2016 Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare. https://t.co/gBnsNgomom I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.  Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N.Y. bosses. Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday. Get tough and smart U.S., or we won't have a country anymore! Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday! You will not want to miss this rally! #Trump2016 https://t.co/J2wyAfXdlz https://t.co/lErVfowpMX Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them...but they won't buy from U.S., rather Airbus! In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners. They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list. This will create great incentive for others! Interesting read from Peggy Noonan. https://t.co/jAxIy8xseM Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him. Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics! If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. 
https://t.co/hxdfy0mjVw Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him! Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks? Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate. The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there! Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer! Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.  @FrankLuntz is a total clown. Has zero credibility!  @FoxNews  @megynkelly  @oreillyfactor please explain to the very dumb and failing @glennbeck that I supported John McCain big league in 2008, not Obama! Just got back from Iowa - had a great time with amazing people. Will be back soon! Jusr watched  #HarveyPitt on @TeamCavuto - he was great! Top searched candidate by state, as seen in the #GOPDebate media filing center. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://t.co/nwKPRmWFNr Sen. Lindsey Graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for President and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of Bush.

Won't be that way if I win! Stuart Stevens is a dumb guy who fails @ virtually everything he touches. Romney campaign,his book,etc. Why does @andersoncooper put him on? Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget! Why does @CNN & @andersoncooper waste airtime by putting failed campaign strategist, Stuart Stevens - who lost BIG for Romney - on the show?  @EricTrump- unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta. That was better than I could do! #Trump2016 THANK YOU! #VoteTrump

https://t.co/6kjCaStCjG Sadly, there is no way that Ted Cruz can continue running in the Republican Primary unless he can erase doubt on eligibility. Dems will sue! "@johnkurkosky: @Carolde @The_Lady_Colors  @DRJAMESCABOT @TamiDurling @AceofSpadesHQ THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT AMERICAS FUTURE, VOTE TRUMP" Iran toys with U.S. days before we pay them, ridiculously, billions of dollars. Don't release money. We want our hostages back NOW! Numerous polls have me beating Hillary Clinton. In a race with her, voter turnout will be the highest in U.S. history-I get most new voters! The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast! Just found out that @tedcruz is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great. The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch! The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia. #SOTU New CBS poll. #Trump2016
https://t.co/sFPRHHeLbd Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem. https://t.co/cNl6dmFb6q On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!

You will not be disappointed!  @NBC Face The Nation's interview of me was the highest rated show that they have had in 15 years. Congratulations and WOW!  @CBSNews @jdickerson  @MajorCBS Major Garrett of @CBSNews covers me very inaccurately. Total agenda, bad reporter! Will be on @FallonTonight with @JimmyFallon on @NBC at 11:35pmE. Enjoy! #Trump2016 https://t.co/Z9zbKfXJqb  @megynkelly recently said that she cant be wooed by Trump. She is so average in every way, who the hell wants to woo her!  @RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same. So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive, highly unethical! Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved! Why does @ThisWeekABC w/ @GStephanopoulos allow a hater & racist like @tavissmiley to waste good airtime? @ABC can do much better than him! Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher! UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH. This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed. If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isnt questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who cant win. I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate. https://t.co/DL8hDPzHoi Remember, get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch... Heading now for Reno, Nevada, for a big rally. Good poll numberd all over! In the just out @FoxNews Poll, I easily beat Hillary Clinton - and I havn't even focused on her yet. On our way: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Yesterday in Iowa was amazing - two speeches in front of two great sold out crowds. They love that I am the only candidate self-funding! I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday! Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy! I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in! I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved! (2/2) David brilliantly tells it like it is -- the real deal! Read it! 
https://t.co/9n5CCrefKn (1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had. Constitutional law expert  #Laurence Tribe of Harvard says "wrong to say it (natural born citizen) is a settled matter-it isn't settled). South Carolina rally last night was so unbelievably exciting (and fun). I am now off to Iowa for two big rallies - packed houses. Love it! Pat Buchanan gave a fantastic interview this morning on @CNN - way to go Pat, way ahead of your time! Will be at venue, in wonderful South Carolina, very soon. Big traffic back-up, tremendous crowd!

Dont let them sell you out! On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it! Not good news for Jeb Bush  https://t.co/5CrP5zdXsz Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the @JebBush campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!

Joy Behar, who was fired from her last show for lack of ratings, is even worse on @TheView. We love Barbara! The @TheView @ABC, once great when headed by @BarbaraJWalters, is now in total freefall. Whoopi Goldberg is terrible. Very sad! Hillary and her friends! https://t.co/q45tTapqMI Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response. False advertising! I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster. Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it!  @SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue. Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win! Massive crowd in VT tonight. Venue not big enough. Officials say NO to outside event and sound system. Arrive early! Man shot inside Paris police station. Just announced that terror threat is at highest level. Germany is a total mess-big crime. GET SMART! I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally. Will be great fun. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago. Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted!  @Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%. Very disloyal company. Another win for Trump! Boycott. The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N.H. just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads. How stupid, how desperate! Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads? Look at enclosed letter from them, just received: https://t.co/NucdHBZAH9 I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today. Please join us 5PM ET. Huge crowd expected tomorrow night!

Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won! Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary? She LOST! Now Bill is at it again. Just watch. Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe. If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm! Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must. Hillary lied! Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D.T. video. The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate. Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening. "@Granite_Hope: @brandonstinney How can you deny this fact.HillaryClinton and BarackObama are the two people who made #ISIS a big problem" Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally. Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive. Will be an amazing evening! Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party. I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U.S.A.! When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$! I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women! Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better! Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!  @JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!  @JebBush is a sad case. A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads!

I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! Is it legal for a sitting President to be "wire tapping" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! Just out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone. Terrible!

Congratulation to Jane Timken on her major upset victory in becoming the Ohio Republican Party Chair. Jane is a loyal Trump supporter & star both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD! have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and.... Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only "stupid" people, or fools, would think that it is bad! We..... Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed! Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched! Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place.The Republican National Committee had strong defense! Happy Birthday @EricTrump!
https://t.co/bJaEY7qFSn Monitoring the terrible situation in Florida. Just spoke to Governor Scott. Thoughts and prayers for all. Stay safe! I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it. Anna Wintour came to my office at Trump Tower to ask me to meet with the editors of Conde Nast & Steven Newhouse, a friend. Will go this AM. being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14. Now compare him to my season 1. But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got "swamped" (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT. So much for.... Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D.C. on January 20th. It will be a GREAT SHOW! and knew they were in big trouble - which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.THEY SAW A MOVEMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE Hillary and the Dems were never going to beat the PASSION of my voters. They saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the...... The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later! So how and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on? The Democratic National Committee would not allow the FBI to study or see its computer info after it was supposedly hacked by Russia...... How did NBC get "an exclusive look into the top secret report he (Obama) was presented?" Who gave them this report and why? Politics! Toyota Motor said will build a new plant in Baja, Mexico, to build Corolla cars for U.S. NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax. to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against "Intelligence" when in fact I am a big fan! The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people.... ...time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER! ...do the typical political thing and BLAME. The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning."Keep you doctor, keep your plan!" It is.... The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it, they.. Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don't understand the "Movement" massive increases of ObamaCare will take place this year and Dems are to blame for the mess. It will fall of its own weight - be careful! like the 116% hike in Arizona. Also, deductibles are so high that it is practically useless. Don't let the Schumer clowns out of this web... Republicans must be careful in that the Dems own the failed ObamaCare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases...... things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media, as usual, gave them a pass. Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have "hacking defense" like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible...... "@FoxNews: Julian Assange on U.S. media coverage: Its very dishonest. #Hannity https://t.co/ADcPRQifH9" More dishonest than anyone knows Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info! The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange! "Trump is already delivering the jobs he promised America" https://t.co/11spTMa6Tm There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield. Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world's great magnet for INNOVATION & JOB CREATION.

Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said "The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!" - And, it is lousy healthcare. People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable - 116% increases (Arizona). Bill Clinton called it "CRAZY" General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! I thought and felt I would win big, easily over the fabled 270 (306). When they cancelled fireworks, they knew, and so did I. Various media outlets and pundits say that I thought I was going to lose the election. Wrong, it all came together in the last week and..... Chicago murder rate is record setting - 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016. If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help! Well, the New Year begins. We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! TO ALL AMERICANS-
